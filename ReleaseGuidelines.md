## Versioning

MDS uses [Semantic Versioning][semver]. Each release is associated with a [`git tag`][mds-tags] of the form `X.Y.Z`.

Given that MDS is stabilizing under MAJOR version `0.x` right now, it should be assumed that MINOR version increments (e.g. `0.2.0` to `0.3.0`) are equivalent to MAJOR version increments and may contain breaking changes.

### Ongoing version support

At this early stage, MDS will be moving relatively quickly with an eye toward stabilization rather than backwards-compatibility.

For now, MDS will maintain *two concurrent (MINOR) versions* (e.g. if `0.3.0` were the current version, the `0.2.x` series would continue to receive maintenance in addition to `0.3.x`).


## Release Process
The sections below define the release process itself, including timeline, roles, and communication best practices.

> **The process defined below currently being piloted with the MDS `provider` API only. Proposed changes to the `agency` API will be continue to be reviewed on an ad hoc basis.**

>**It is our intent to maintain a level of coordination between the technical direction of `agency` and `provider`. As such, proposed changes to either API will be reviewed to ensure they do not create unnecessary duplicative functionality, introduce confusion about which API should be used for a given purpose, or prevent the reconciliation of data between the two APIs (for example: using data from `provider` to cross-validate data received via `agency`).**

### Goals

* _Fast, regular releases to support rapid evolution of MDS_

* _Consensus-oriented with clear decision making process when consensus can't be reached_

* _Encourage involvement from all stakeholders, especially public agencies_

* _Frequent stakeholder communication on GitHub, web conference, and in-person_

* _Regular review of release process to ensure it is serving the needs of the community._


### Roles
* **contributors** - Anyone making pull requests, opening issues, or engaging in technical discussion around implementation of features.
* **maintainers** - Project maintainers have commit privileges in the main MDS repository and are responsible for implementing changes such as merging of pull requests and the creation of release branches.
* **release partner** - Review changes when consensus cannot be reached and make final release inclusion recommendations to maintainers for approval.

As of March 2019, LADOT and the City of Santa Monica are the project maintainers and Remix is the release partner.

### Schedule

MDS operates on a six-week release cycle for both major updates (0.x) and patches (0.x.y). In general, major updates (0.x) are expected no more than once per quarter. The release cycle is broken down as follows:

**week 1 - proposals**

Contributors submit proposals for inclusion in the release cycle in the form of pull requests and issues tagged with the Milestone for the upcoming release. Proposals should come with enough explanation to allow all stakeholders to understand intent and implementation strategy. |

**weeks 2-4 - consensus building, refinement, and implementation**

Contributors will provide feedback on proposals. Where possible, discussion will happen via GitHub. Weekly calls will support dialog around more complex or controversial issues. By the end of week 4, all active proposals must be in the form of a pull request. Proposals can be withdrawn or split apart for inclusion in future releases.

**week 5 - decision making**

The week will start with an in-person/web conference work session for all contributors to review and discuss current proposals. Goal is to achieve consensus where possible, or to clearly articulate areas of disagreement where not. Minor changes may be accepted at this stage if they bring contributors to consensus.

At the conclusion of week 5, release partner will review all items for which consensus was not reached and provide a recommended release plan to maintainers for approval. Any remaining approved pull requests to `dev` are merged or the release branch as necessary.

**week 6 - release**

â€‹Documentation will be updated, a release branch will be created if necessary, changes will be merged into `master`, and new version will be formally released.

### Communication and Workflow
The release annoncements and process schedule will be communicated via [`mds-announce`][mds-announce] Google Group. People wishing to stay informed should join the group for updates. Timing of web conference and in person work sessions will be communicated via mds-announce as well.

The following best practices are intended to create clarity around each release cycle:

* Categorize issues and PRs under an associated [Milestone][mds-milestones] for the release

* Assign a due date for said Milestone that aligns with proposed release date

* Pull requests and release notes should include a summary of the major changes / impacts associated with the change or release

* Proposed changes should come in the form of PRs to give the community ample awareness and time for feedback

## Branch Mechanics

Aside from using `git tags` as mentioned earlier, here we outline a branching strategy to handle ongoing maintenance changes in parallel with features for new releases.

### Primary branches

At a high-level, there are two primary branches:

* [`master`][mds-master] represents the current stable release (i.e. the most recent tag) of MDS. Development work generally *does not* happen here, but is rather merged from elsewhere.

* [`dev`][mds-dev] represents work on the next MINOR release, and is the *long-term* development branch.

### Feature branches

Work on new features for MDS happens in branches cut from `dev`. When the feature is ready for review, submit a PR against `dev`, ideally with any merge conflicts already resolved. `dev` serves as the collection point for all new feature work.

### Release branches

In anticipation of ongoing maintenance, a branch will be created for the current release series. For example, at the time `0.2.0` is released, a branch will be cut from `master` for `0.2.x`.

This *release branch* represents the current state of that release series. All maintenance/bugfix work for the series is collected in this branch. To work on a patch, cut a branch from the release branch. When ready, submit a PR against the release branch.

When a PATCH release is ready (e.g. `0.2.0` to `0.2.1`), the release branch (e.g. `0.2.x`) is merged to `master` (to make the release official) and `dev` is rebased onto `master` (to ensure the patch is incorporated with any new work).

Breaking changes should always be merged to develop. These may be merged at any time and will be incorporated into the next minor release. For non-breaking changes, these should either be merged to develop if the next release is a minor release, or to the appropriate release branch if the next version is a patch release. During each cycle, we merge changes to both dev and 0.n.x branches, so breaking changes can be proposed and worked on at any time

As stated earlier, at this time MDS will maintain *two concurrent MINOR versions*. This means that when a MINOR release is made (e.g. `0.4.0`), work on the outgoing series (`0.2.x`, in this case) ceases and its release branch is removed.

## Release Checklist

The following steps **must** be followed for **every** release of MDS:

1. Ensure the [Milestone][mds-milestones] for this release is at `100%`.

1. Update the [schema version regex][mds-schema-common]

1. Run the schema generator to ensure the schema files are up to date:

   ```console
   cd generate_schema/
   pipenv run python generate_provider_schema.py
   ```

1. Update [`ReleaseNotes.md`](ReleaseNotes.md) following the existing format:

    ```md
    ## 1.2.3

    > Released yyyy-MM-dd

    High level summary of the release.

    * Specific change referencing a PR [#555](https://github.com/CityofLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification/pull/555)

    * Another change summary referencing a PR [#777](https://github.com/CityofLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification/pull/777)
    ```

1. [Open a PR][mds-pr-new] against `master`, comparing either `dev` (for a MINOR release) or a release branch (e.g. `0.2.x`) for a PATCH release.

    In the case of a new MINOR version, allow a minimum of 24 hours for community discussion and review of the PR.

1. Once the PR has been sufficiently reviewed, `rebase merge` into `master`.

1. Create a tag on the tip of `master` for this release, e.g. for `0.3.0`:

    ```console
    git checkout master
    git fetch && git pull
    git tag 0.3.0
    git push --tags
    ```

1. Publish a [new Release in GitHub][mds-releases-new] for the tag you just pushed. Copy in the [release notes](ReleaseNotes.md) created earlier.

1. What kind of release was this?
   * **PATCH:** rebase `dev` onto `master` to incorporate the PATCH into `dev`

       *Caution: be aware that this may impact existing PRs open against `dev`!*

        ```console
        git checkout dev
        git rebase master
        git push --force origin dev
        ```

   * **MINOR:** cut a new branch for this release series from the tip of `master`

        Make this branch the default branch in GitHub. E.g. for `0.3.0`

        ```console
        git checkout master
        git checkout -b 0.3.x
        git push origin 0.3.x
        ```

       Remove any outgoing series' release branch (e.g. `0.1.x` when releasing `0.3.0`), if applicable.

1. Post a release announcement to [`mds-announce`](mailto:mds-announce@googlegroups.com), copying the [release notes](ReleaseNotes.md) created earlier and linking to the [GitHub release][mds-releases].

    ```email
    From:    mds-announce@googlegroups.com  
    To:      mds-announce@googlegroups.com  
    Subject: MDS 1.2.3 Release  

    MDS 1.2.3 has been released.
