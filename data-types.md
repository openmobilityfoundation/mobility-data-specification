### Vehicle Types

The list of allowed `vehicle_type` values in MDS.

| `vehicle_type`     | Description |

| `car`              | A passenger car or similar light-duty vehicle |
| `delivery_robot`   | A robot or remote-operated device intended for transporting goods |
| `moped`            | A seated fully-motorized mobility device capable of travel at moderate or high speeds and suited for operation in general urban traffic |

### Propulsion Types

The list of allowed `propulsion_type` values in MDS.

| `propulsion`         | Description                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `human`              | Pedal or foot propulsion |
| `electric_assist`    | Provides electric motor assist only in combination with human propulsion - no throttle mode |
| `electric`           | Powered by battery-powered electric motor with throttle mode |
| `combustion`         | Powered by gasoline combustion engine |
| `combustion_diesel`  | Powered by diesel combustion engine |
| `hybrid`             | Powered by combined combustion engine and battery-powered motor |
| `hydrogen_fuel_cell` | Powered by hydrogen fuel cell powered electric motor |
| `plug_in_hybrid`     | Powered by combined combustion engine and battery-powered motor with plug-in charging |

A vehicle may have one or more values from the `propulsion`, depending on the number of modes of operation. For example, a scooter that can be powered by foot or by electric motor would have the `propulsion` represented by the array `['human', 'electric']`. A bicycle with pedal-assist would have the `propulsion` represented by the array `['human', 'electric_assist']` if it can also be operated as a traditional bicycle.

Values based off of `propulsion_type` in [GBFS vehicle_types](https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md#vehicle_typesjson).

### Event Times

Because of the unreliability of device clocks, the provider is unlikely to know with total confidence what time an event occurred at. However, providers are responsible for constructing as accurate a timeline as possible. Most importantly, the order of the timestamps for a particular device's events must reflect the provider's best understanding of the order in which those events occurred.

## Stops

Stops describe vehicle trip start and end locations in a pre-designated physical place. They can vary from docking stations with or without charging, corrals with lock-to railings, or suggested parking areas marked with spray paint. Stops are used in both [Provider](/provider#stops) and [Agency](/agency#stops) telemetry data.

## Incidents

 Incidents are used in both [Provider](/provider#stops) and [Agency](/agency#stops) telemetry data, whether on or off a Trip. 

| Field              | Type            | Required/Optional      | Comments |
| ----               | ----            | ----                   | ----     |
| `incident_id`      | UUID            | Required               | ID used for uniquely identifying an Incident. |
| `incident_type`    | Enum            | Required               | The type of incident. One of `unplanned_stop`, `remote_takeover`, `tip_over`, `harsh_stopping` (e.g. braking), `harsh_starting` (e.g. acceleration), `near_miss`, `vandalism`, `crash`. |

## Reports

A Report is defined by the following structure:

| Column Name          | Type                                      | Comments                                         |
|----------------------| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `provider_id`        | UUID                                      | A UUID for the Provider, unique within MDS. See MDS provider_id in [provider list](/providers.csv). |
| `start_date`         | date                                      | Start date of the [Trip](#trips) data row, in ISO 8601 date format, i.e. YYYY-MM-DD |
| `duration`           | string                                    | Value is always `P1M` for monthly. Based on [ISO 8601 duration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) |
| `special_group_type` | [Special Group Type](#special-group-type) | Type that applies to this row                    |
| `geography_id`       | [Geography](/geography)                   | ID that applies to this row. Includes all IDs in /geography. When there is no /geography then return `null` for this value and return counts based on the entire operating area. |
| `vehicle_type`       | [Vehicle Type][vehicle-types]      | Type that applies to this row                    |
| `trip_count`         | integer                                   | Count of trips taken for this row                |
| `rider_count`        | integer                                   | Count of unique riders for this row              |

### Data Notes

Report contents include every combination of special group types, geography IDs, and vehicle types in operation for each month since the provider began operations in the jurisdiction. New files are added monthly in addition to the previous monthly historic files.

Counts are calculated based the agency's local time zone. Trips are counted based on their start time, i.e. if a trip starts in month A but ends in month B, it will be counted only as part of the report for month A. Similarly, trips are counted based on their start geography, i.e. if a trip starts in geography A and ends in geography B, it will appear in the counts for geography A and not for geography B.

All geography IDs included in the city published [Geography](/geography) API endpoint are included in the report results. In lieu of serving an API, this can alternately be a [flat file](/geography#file-format) created by the city and sent to the provider via link. If there is no `/geography` available, then counts are for the entire agency operating area, and `null` is returned for each Geography ID.

### Data Redaction

Some combinations of parameters may return a small count of trips, which could increase a privacy risk of re-identification. To correct for that, Reports does not return data below a certain count of results. This data redaction is called k-anonymity, and the threshold is set at a k-value of 10. For more explanation of this methodology, see our [Data Redaction Guidance document](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/wiki/MDS-Data-Redaction).

**If the query returns fewer than `10` trips in a count, then that row's count value is returned as "-1".** Note "0" values are also returned as "-1" since the goal is to group both low and no count values for privacy.

This value may be adjusted in future releases and/or may become dynamic to account for specific categories of use cases and users. To improve the specification and to inform future guidance, users are encouraged to share their feedback and questions about k-values on this [discussion thread](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/discussions/622).

Using k-anonymity will reduce, but not necessarily eliminate the risk that an individual could be re-identified in a dataset, and this data should still be treated as sensitive. This is just one part of good privacy protection practices, which you can read more about in our [MDS Privacy Guide for Cities](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/blob/main/documents/OMF-MDS-Privacy-Guide-for-Cities.pdf).

### Special Group Type

Here are the possible values for the `special_group_type` dimension field:

| Name             | Description                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| low_income       | Trips where a low income discount is applied by the provider, e.g., a discount from a qualified provider equity plan. |
| adaptive_scooter | Trips taken on a scooter with features to improve accessibility for people with disabilities, e.g., scooter with a seat or wider base |
| all_riders       | All riders from any group                                                                                             |

Other special group types may be added in future MDS releases as relevant agency and provider use cases are identified. When additional special group types or metrics are proposed, a thorough review of utility and relevance in program oversight, evaluation, and policy development should be done by OMF Working Groups, as well as any privacy implications by the OMF Privacy Committee.
