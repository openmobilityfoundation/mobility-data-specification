## 0.1.1

> Released 2018-10-15

This release backports two features from [`0.2.0`](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification/releases/tag/0.2.0):

* Clarifying Location Types as GeoJSON [#94](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification/pull/94)

* Adding `electric-assist` as a propulsion type [#48](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification/pull/48)
