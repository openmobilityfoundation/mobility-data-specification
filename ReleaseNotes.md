#### **_Admin/General Changes_**

- Update [state machine diagrams](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fHdq1efbN5GSFDLF4en-oA_BYPXQKbbIbHff6iROJKA/edit?usp=sharing) and create 4 new diagrams for each mode
- [Remove Schema and instead link to OpenAPI repo](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/281)
   - OpenAPI support in place of JSON Schema allows easier building of real-time MDS endpoint validation, and interactive documentation on Stoplight.

    - Updated MDS alignment with GBFS to include all of their vehicle types (including seated scooter) and the addition of new ones for modes (bus, truck, delivery robot, motorcycle), all propulsion types, and to require GBFS for only micromobility and car share (delivery robots and passenger services are option, but not well supported in GBFS).
- [Added maintenance_pick_up event for out of PROW work](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/595)
- Ability to send tip overs, surface type, and parking validation [data if available from sensors](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/pull/829)

- All vehicle states are now clearly in or out of the right of way, [no unknown state](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/770)
- Many [new provider IDs added](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22identifier+change%22+milestone%3A2.0.0)

#### **_Modes Architecture_** 

- [Support for multiple modes/services in MDS](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/574) 
   - Updates the base of MDS to have some shared objects and fields, and specific fields as needed for each mode.
   - Adds specific modes to MDS, with help from Member Networks, and existing real world data exchanges between operators, agencies, and solution providers.
   - Operators must register a unique UUID for each mode they operate under. 

**Passenger Services**
- [Passenger services/TNC/taxi support ](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/95) 

**Delivery Robots**
- [Support for vehicles like delivery robots](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/782)  

**Car Share**

**Work to bring modes together**

- [Add a "Data Provider UUID" to MDS](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/805) 
   - New data provider id allows endpoints to include who is producing and serving up the data. Software companies and solution providers are [encouraged to register](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/tree/feature-modes-cleanup#software-companies-using-mds) for their own global UUID now to serve up operator or agency data with MDS.
- [Support for Modes in Policy](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/614) - specify which mode your policy applies to

#### **_Policy Reimagining_**

A reimagining of Policy, including top ten most common policies are clearly defined, edge cases (dwell time, trip definition, rule units, updating/ending policies, lookback periods) are clarified, Stops is out of beta, and Policy feeds are public

- [Move out of beta](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/682)

#### **_Agency/Provider Unification_**

The difference between Agency and Provider is that with Agency operators PUSH data to cities, and with Provider cities PULL data from operators. Both share the same data types, referenced in a new file, with the same endpoints and fields available.

- [MDS Agency and Provider Unification](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/759)
  - Endpoints are now identical
  - Data objects are now identical, referenced in new data-type.md file
  - Distinction between Agency and Provider is now simply pushing data to agencies, or pulling data from operators
- [Adding trips endpoint to Agency](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/550)

## 0.4.0

> Release 2019-10-31

The 0.4.0 release represents a major step forward in the Mobility Data Specification. The `provider` endpoints have been refactored to allow static file backed API servers which should improve uptime, reliability and the ability to backfill what is now growing to years of data. There is a new `policy` API endpoint, designed to be implemented by Agencies, that allows for clearer communication of geofencing, vehicle caps and more. A full list of changes is below. Many thanks to all the contributors who helped on this release.

## 0.2.1

> Released 2018-12-03

This release is the first patch release of MDS 0.2.

We did not chose to include the `timestamp` change, as discussed in issue #104, because it is breaking. Early versions of this branch included that change. The change will be made in MDS 0.3.0.

### CHANGES

* Release Guidelines. Ref  #147 #129
* Many Validator Fixes/Null Fixes. Ref #166 #165 #128
* Many Clarifications / Cleanup to make the spec easier to read.
* JSON Schema is now much closer to the written spec, fails on Null if required, doesn't fail if field is not required.

Thanks to all contributors.

## 0.1.1

> Released 2018-10-15

This release backports two features from [`0.2.0`](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/releases/tag/0.2.0):

* Clarifying Location Types as GeoJSON [#94](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/pull/94)

* Adding `electric-assist` as a propulsion type [#48](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/pull/48)

This makes MDS `0.1.x` series more usable for Mobility Providers.

## 0.2.0

> Released 2018-10-01

This release includes a number of enhancements and clarifications to the [`provider`][provider] spec:

* Introduce JSON Schema for Trips and Status Changes [#53](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/pull/53)

* Clarify query params for API endpoints [#64](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/pull/64)

* Clarify API authentication method [#81](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/pull/81)

* Clarify location formatting [#94](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/pull/94)

## 0.1.0

> Released 2018-09-11

* Initial release!

* MDS is under active development. As such, pre-`1.0` versions may introduce breaking changes until things stabilize. Every effort will be made to ensure that any breaking change is well documented and that appropriate workarounds are suggested.
