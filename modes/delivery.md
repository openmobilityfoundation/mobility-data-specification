# Mobility Data Specification: **Delivery**


**Delivey** refers to all forms of deliveries.  Deliveries may or may not have a driver, there can be one or multiple orders on different trips at the same time.  The state machine tracks the trip states of the orders separately from the vehicle state.  

See the [modes overview](/modes) for how the mode specific information below applies across MDS.

## Robots Vs Other vehicles types
Robots do not require a driver whereas other forms of deliveries do. For most of the robots delivery operators, there is only one order at once. The idea here is to anticipate all forms of deliveries and to accept having many orders at once on one vehicle.

## Mode Attributes

### Mode ID

The short name identifier for deliveries used across MDS is `delivery`.

### Journey ID

Journeys may be point-to-point, multi-segment, or multi-segment overlapping.

### Trip ID Requirements

Events require a valid `trip_id` in events where `event_types` contains `reservation_start`, `reservation_stop`, `trip_start`, `trip_stop`, `trip_end`, `customer_cancellation`, `provider_cancellation`, or `driver_cancellation`. 

For the robots, the notion of driver does not exist

Additionally, `trip_id` is required if `event_types` contains a `enter_jurisdiction` or `leave_jurisdiction` event pertaining to a delivery trip. 

### Trip Type

The `trip_type` field is used to describe the trip itself. It can be 'delivery' or 'roaming' or 'return' or 'advertising'

### Trip Attributes

The `trip_attributes` array can be used with in delivery.


### Vehicle Attributes

The `vehicle_attributes` array may have the following key value pairs:


- `year` (integer, optional)
- `make` (string, optional)
- `model` (string, optional)
- `color` (string, optional)
- `inspection_date` (date YYYY-MM-DD, optional) - the date of the last inspection of the vehicle

### State Machine Diagram

The *Delivery Diagram* shows how the `vehicle_state` and `event_type` relate to each other and how delivery vehicles can transition between states. 

#### Delivery State Notes

When there is only one trip ongoing, `trip_state == vehicle_state`

In cases where there are multiple trips ongoing, please follow the trip state model pseudocode for determining what the vehicle state should be:
```
t = for the one vehicle, all on-going trips which are 'delivey' or undefined trips (we do not take into account 'roaming', 'return' or 'advertising' trips)
v = vehicle state
if t.any(state == ‘stopped’):
    v = ‘stopped’ 
else:
if t.any(state == ‘on_trip’):      
    v = ‘on_trip’
else:
if t.any(state == ‘reserved’):
    v = ‘reserved’
else:
if t=[]:
    v = ‘available’

```
`trip_state` mappings should be the same as in the table above.
