# Mobility Data Specification: **Delivery Robots**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/f8iMepu.png" width="120" align="right" alt="MDS Modes - Delivey Robots" border="0">

**Delivey Robots** refers to autonomous and remotely driven goods delivery devices. There can be one or multiple orders on different trips at the same time. The state machine tracks the trip states of the orders separately from the vehicle state.  

See the [modes overview](/modes) for how the mode specific information below applies across MDS.

## Robots Vs Other Delivery Types

Autonomous and remotely piloted delivery robots do not require a driver, whereas other forms of deliveries may, e.g. in a commerical or private car, truck, bike, etc. For this MDS release, this mode is limited to deliveries where a human driver is not on board the vehicle doing the delivery, and human passengers are not being transported.

## Mode Attributes

### Mode ID

The short name identifier for deliveries used across MDS is `delivery-robots`.

## Trip Properties

### Journey ID

The `journey_id` field shall have a consistent value in overlapping trips. Journeys may be point-to-point, multi-segment, or multi-segment overlapping.

Example 1: delivery to a single location, then return
```
<-                  Journey               ->
<- Trip: delivery -><-    Trip: return    ->
```

Example 2: three overlapping delivery trips in the same journey
```
<-                                 Journey                                  ->
<- Trip: delivery ->
                    <- Trip: delivery ->
                                        <- Trip: delivery -><- Trip: return ->
```

### Journey Attributes

The `journey_attributes` array is not used in this mode.

### Trip ID Requirements

Events require a valid `trip_id` in events where `event_types` contains `reservation_start`, `reservation_stop`, `trip_start`, `trip_pause`, `trip_end`, `customer_cancellation`, `provider_cancellation`, or `driver_cancellation`. 

For the robots, the notion of driver does not exist, even when remotely operated.

Additionally, `trip_id` is required if `event_types` contains a `enter_jurisdiction` or `leave_jurisdiction` event pertaining to a delivery trip. 

### Trip Type

The `trip_type` field is used to describe the trip itself. 

The `trip_type` field **must** have one of the following enumerated values:

- `delivery`: making a delivery
- `return`: returning to home location or next trip start
- `advertising`: displaying advertising and not making a delivery
- `mapping`: mapping the environment and not making a delivery
- `roaming`: moving in right of way but not in another trip_type

### Trip Attributes

The `trip_attributes` array **may** have the following key value pairs:

- `driver_type` (ennum, required): type of driver operating the device: `human`, `semi-autonomous`, `autonomous`
- `driver_id` (UUID, optional): consistent unique identifier of the privary driver. Could be based on software version or an internal human driver id.
- `app_name` (text, optional): name of the app used to reserve the trip which could be provider's app or 3rd party app
- `request_time` (timestamp, optional): when the customer requested the trip
- `has_payload` (boolean, optional): is there any payload for any delivery included in the device at trip start. 1 = loaded, 0 = empty
- `range` (interger, optional): estimated range in meters based on energy levels in device at trip start
- `identification_required` (boolean, optional): does the cargo require providing customer identification before trip start or upon delivery?

_See more available trip attributes for any mode in the [trips endpoint](/provider#trips)._

### Fare Attributes

The `fare_attributes` array **may** have the following key value pairs:

- `payment_type` (enumerated, optional): `cash`, `mobile`, `voucher`, `paratransit`, `no payment`, `test`
- `price` (currency, optional): Total price of the order

### State Machine Diagram

The *Delivery Diagram* shows how the `vehicle_state` and `event_type` relate to each other and how delivery vehicles can transition between states. 

TBD

#### Delivery Robots State Notes

When there is only one trip ongoing, `trip_state == vehicle_state`

In cases where there are multiple trips ongoing, please follow the trip state model pseudocode for determining what the vehicle state should be:
```
t = for the one vehicle, all on-going trips which are 'delivey' or undefined trips (we do not take into account 'roaming', 'return' or 'advertising' trips)
v = vehicle state
if t.any(state == ‘stopped’):
    v = ‘stopped’ 
else:
if t.any(state == ‘on_trip’):      
    v = ‘on_trip’
else:
if t.any(state == ‘reserved’):
    v = ‘reserved’
else:
if t=[]:
    v = ‘available’

```
`trip_state` mappings should be the same as in the table above.
