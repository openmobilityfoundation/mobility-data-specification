# Mobility Data Specification: **Passenger Services**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/plW2Hon.png" width="120" align="right" alt="MDS Modes - Passenger Services" border="0">

**Passenger Services** refers to taxis, transportation network companies (TNCs), commercial transport apps (CTAs), and private hire vehicles (PHVs).  Passenger Services typically have a driver, one or more passengers, and multiple passengers may be on different trips.  The state machine tracks the trip states of the passengers separately from the vehicle state.  

See the [modes overview](/modes) for how the mode specific information below applies across MDS.

## Taxi vs. TNC implementation differences

Taxis typically require explicit tracking of maintenance while TNCs typically do not. Public agency regulations, legal authority, differ based on local, state, and federal laws and jursidictions between taxis, TNCs, CTAs, PHV, etc.

## Mode Attributes

### Mode ID

The short name identifier for Passenger Services used across MDS is `passenger-services`.

[Top][toc]

## Trip Properties

### Journey ID

The `journey_id` field shall have a consistent value in overlapping trips, e.g. "pooled" or "shared" rides with different start and/or end locations. Journeys may be point-to-point, multi-segment, or multi-segment overlapping.

Example 1: one private trip with reservation, then return to depot
```
<-                            Journey                           ->
<- Trip: reservation -><-    Trip: private    -><- Trip: empty  ->
```

Example 2: three shared trips, some overlapping
```
<-                            Journey                           ->
<- Trip: reservation -><- Trip: shared ->
            <- Trip: reservation -><- Trip: shared ->
                         <- Trip: reservation -><- Trip: shared ->
```

### Journey Attributes

The `journey_attributes` array **may** have the following key value pairs:

- `shift_id` (UUID, optional): unique identifier for an entire driver's work shift, tied across multiple journeys and therefore trips.

[Top][toc]

### Trip ID Requirements

Events require a valid `trip_id` in events where `event_types` contains `reservation_start`, `reservation_stop`, `trip_start`, `trip_stop`, `trip_end`, `passenger_cancellation`, `provider_cancellation`, or `driver_cancellation`. 

Additionally, `trip_id` is required if `event_types` contains a `enter_jurisdiction` or `leave_jurisdiction` event pertaining to a passenger trip. 

[Top][toc]

### Trip Type

The `trip_type` field **must** have one of the following enumerated values:

- `private`: a private trip made by one paying customer with one or more guests
- `shared`: a shared or pooled trip with more than one paying customer
- `reservation`: en route to pickup a customer who has made a reservation, with no passengers in the vehicle
- `empty`: vehicle movement with no passengers (outside of other `trip_type` values) that may need to be reported, e.g. for deadheading

[Top][toc]

### Trip Attributes

The `trip_attributes` array **may** have the following key value pairs:

- `hail_type` (enumerated, required): `street_hail`, `phone_dispatch`, `phone`, `text`, `app`
- `app_name` (text, optional): name of the app used to reserve the trip which could be provider's app or 3rd party app
- `passenger_count` (integer, required): unique count of passengers transported during trip duration
- `request_time` (timestamp, required): when the passenger requested the trip
- `trip_wait_time` (milliseconds, optional): part of the passenger trip where the vehicle was moving slow or stopped (e.g. <12mph), which is a different fare rate in some jurisdictions
- `trip_fare_time` (milliseconds, optional): part of the passenger trip where the vehicle was moving more quickly (e.g. >12mph), which is a different fare rate in some jurisdictions
- `pickup_address` (text, optional): street address where the trip originated from
- `dropoff_address` (text, optional): street address where the trip ended
- `permit_licence_number` (string, optional) - The permit licence number of the organization that dispatched the vehicle
- `driver_id` (string, optional): Universal identifier of a specific driver, static across operators, like a driver's license number. Could also be used as a lookup in an agency's internal driver system.
- `wheelchair_transported` (boolean, optional) - was a wheelchair transported as part of this trip?

- `fare_type` (enumerated, required): `meter_fare`, `upfront_pricing`, `flat_rate`. Indicator of which rate was charged.
- `meter_fare_amount` (currency, conditionally required): if `upfront_pricing` is used as a `fare_type` include what the metered fare would have been if `meter_fare` would have been used. Allows cost comparison in evalutation of programs and pilots.
- `tolls` (currency, optional) - Sum of any and all tolls charged for the trip, such as bridge tolls
- `base_rate` (currency, optional) - Minimum fare to be charged as soon as the trip starts.
- `exit_fee` (currency, optional) - Fee to exit location, like an airport
- `other_fees` (currency, optional) - amount of any fees charged to the customer. Includes baggage fees, cleaning fee. Excludes other fees returned.

- `taxes` (currency, optional) - amount of taxes paid for the ride
- `surcharge` (currency, optional) - any surcharge pricing
- `commission` (currency, optional) - any extra commission for the ride
- `driver_trip_pay` (currency, optional) - The payment the driver received for the trip

### Accessibility Options

This `accessibility_options` enum represents the accessibility options available on a given vehicle, or the accessibility options utilized for a given trip.

|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `wheelchair_accessible` | This vehicle is wheelchair accessible |

## State Machine

### Vehicle States

Valid passenger services vehicle states are 

- `removed`
- `available` 
- `non_operational` 
- `reserved` 
- `on_trip` 
- `stopped`
- `non_contactable` 
- `elsewhere`  

See [Vehicle States][vehicle-states] for descriptions.

[Top][toc]

### Event Types

Valid passenger services vehicle event types are 

- `comms_lost`
- `comms_restored`
- `driver_cancellation`
- `decommission`
- `maintenance_end`
- `maintenance_start`
- `passenger_cancellation`
- `provider_cancellation`
- `recommission`
- `reservation_cancel`
- `reservation_start`
- `service_end`
- `service_start`
- `trip_cancel`
- `trip_end`
- `trip_enter_jurisdiction`
- `trip_leave_jurisdiction`
- `trip_resume`
- `trip_start`
- `trip_stop`
- `unspecified`

This list is somewhat shorter than the micromobility event list, as passenger service vehicles are controlled by a driver or potentially an AI. They are not picked up or dropped off for rebalancing or compliance, for example, and they do not go out of service because of a low battery.

See vehicle [Event Types][vehicle-events] for descriptions.

### State Machine Diagram

The *Passenger Services State Machine Diagram* shows how the `vehicle_state` and `event_type` relate to each other and how taxi vehicles can transition between states. See this [text-editable EPS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WusVpFK1Vm7HSJgNcA_10T74TEzuCpTB/view?usp=sharing) for the source file.

#### Passenger Services State Notes

When there is only one trip ongoing, `trip_state == vehicle_state`

In cases where there are multiple trips ongoing, please follow the trip state model pseudocode for determining what the vehicle state should be:
```
t = all on-going trips for vehicle
v = vehicle state

if t.any(state == ‘stopped’):
v = ‘stopped’ 
else:
if t.any(state == ‘on_trip’):      
v = ‘on_trip’
else:
if t.any(state == ‘reserved’):
    v = ‘reserved’
```
`trip_state` mappings should be the same as in the table above.
