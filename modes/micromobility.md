# Mobility Data Specification: **Micromobility**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YFlUSfz.png" width="120" align="right" alt="MDS Modes - Micromobility" border="0">

"**Micromobility**" refers to single-occupancy modes of docked or dockless transportation such as e-scooters, e-bikes, and human-powered bikes.

See the [modes overview](/modes) for how the mode specific information below applies across MDS.

## Mode Attributes

Some fields used across MDS APIs are defined in more detail within each mode.

### Mode ID

The short name identifier for Micromobility used across MDS is `micromobility`.

### Journey ID

The `journey_id` field is not used with the micromobility mode. Trips are point-to-point.

### Trip ID Requirements

Required in events if `event_types` contains `trip_start`, `trip_end`, `trip_cancel`, `trip_enter_jurisdiction`, or `trip_leave_jurisdiction`.

### Trip Type

The `trip_type` field **may** have one of the following values:

- `rider`: a single rider is taking a trip
- `rebalance`: vehicle ridden by operator to rebalance
- `maintenance`: vehicles ridden by operator to perform maintenance or check operation

### Trip Attributes

The `trip_attributes` array is not used with the micromobility mode.

### Vehicle Attributes

The `vehicle_attributes` array may have the following key value pairs:

- `year` (integer)
- `make` (string)
- `model` (string)

### Propulsion Types

#### Valid for vehicle_types: bicycle, scooter, moped, other

| `propulsion`      |
| ----------------- |
| `human`           |
| `electric_assist` |
| `electric`        |
| `combustion`      |

### Accessibility Options

Accessibility options are not used in micromobility.

## Vehicle States

Valid micromobility vehicle states are 

- `removed`
- `available` 
- `non_operational` 
- `reserved` 
- `on_trip` 
- `elsewhere` 
- `unknown`  

See [Vehicle States][vehicle-states] for descriptions.

## Event Types

Valid micromobility vehicle event types are 

- `agency_drop_off`
- `agency_pick_up`
- `battery_charged`
- `battery_low`
- `comms_lost`
- `comms_restored`
- `compliance_pick_up`
- `decommissioned`
- `located`
- `maintenance`
- `maintenance_pick_up`
- `missing`
- `off_hours`
- `on_hours`
- `provider_drop_off`
- `rebalance_pick_up`
- `reservation_cancel`
- `reservation_start`
- `system_resume`
- `system_suspend`
- `trip_cancel`
- `trip_end`
- `trip_enter_jurisdiction`
- `trip_leave_jurisdiction`
- `trip_start`
- `unspecified`

Note that providers should make best-effort to map their business logic onto these states, which are meant to provide a view of the fleet to an agency.  But if an agency does not perform `agency_drop_off` or `agency_pick_up`, for example, they need not be included in the parovider's implementation.

## Vehicle State Events

This is the list of `vehicle_state` and `event_type` pairings that constitute the valid transitions of the vehicle state machine.

The state-transition table below describes how the `vehicle_state` changes in response to each `event_type`.  Most events will have a single `event_type`.  However, if a single event has more than one ordered `event_type` entry, the intermediate `vehicle_state` value(s) are discarded.  For example, if an event contains [`trip_end`, `battery_low`] then the vehicle transitions from `on_trip` through `available` to `non_operational` per the state machine, but the vehicle is never "in" the `available` state.  

Note that to handle out-of-order events, the validity of the prior-state shall not be enforced at the time of ingest via Provider or Agency.  Events received out-of-order may result in transient incorrect vehicle states.

Vehicles can enter the `unknown` state to and from any other state with the following event types: any state can go to `unknown` with event type `comms_lost`, `missing`, or `unspecified`, and `unknown` can go to any state with event type `comms_restored` of `unspecified`.

| Valid prior `vehicle_state` values | `vehicle_state` | `event_type` | Description |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| `non_operational` | `available`   | `battery_charged`    | The vehicle became available because its battery is now charged. |
| `non_operational` | `available`   | `on_hours`           | The vehicle has entered operating hours (per the regulator or per the provider) |
| `removed`,  `unknown` | `available`   | `provider_drop_off`  | The vehicle was placed in the PROW by the provider |
| `removed`,  `unknown` | `available`   | `agency_drop_off`    | The vehicle was placed in the PROW by a city or county |

| `reserved` | `available`   | `reservation_cancel` | A reservation was canceled and the vehicle returned to service |
| `on_trip` | `available`   | `trip_cancel`        | A trip was initiated, then canceled prior to moving any distance |

| `non_operational`, `unknown`| `available`   | `unspecified`        | The vehicle became available, but the provider cannot definitively (yet) specify the reason.  Generally, regulator Service-Level Agreements will limit the amount of time a vehicle's last event type may be `unspecified`. |

### State Machine Diagram

This *State Machine Diagram* shows how `vehicle_state` and `event_type` relate to each other and how vehicles can transition between states. See [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ar2-ju8YlddSsTATvQw4YjsSa5108XtidtnJNk-UAfA/edit) for the source file.
