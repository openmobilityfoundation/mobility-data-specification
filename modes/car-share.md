# Mobility Data Specification: **Car Share**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HSL9F0h.png" width="120" align="right" alt="MDS Modes - Car Share" border="0">

**Car Share** refers to shared point-to-point and station-based mutli-passenger vehicles.  Car Share typically has a driver who is the customer, and possibly one or more passengers or cargo.  

See the [modes overview](/modes) for how the mode specific information below applies across MDS.

## Mode Attributes

### Mode ID

The short name identifier for Car Share used across MDS is `car-share`.

[Top][toc]

## Trip Properties

### Journey ID

The `journey_id` field shall have a consistent value in overlapping trips for a single reservation period, e.g. trips taken by a customer between ignition states over the duration of their reservation. A reservation is the duration the customer has continuous exclusive access to the vehicle whether parked or in motion. Journeys may be point-to-point or multi-segment.

Example 1: customer makes a reservation and company delivers vehicle to customer, then one trip point-to-point by customer, ending reservation at destination
```
<-                 Journey                ->
<-  Trip: reservation -><-  Trip: private ->
```

Example 2: Customer reservation for multiple days with trips for errands, gas, entertainment, etc
```
<-                                           Journey                                         ->
<- Trip: private -><- Trip: private -><- Trip: private -><- Trip: private -><- Trip: private ->
```

Example 3: one trip point-to-point with an employee moving the vehicle to a new location for maintenance
```
<-    Journey  ->
<- Trip: empty ->
```

### Journey Attributes

The `journey_attributes` array **may** have the following key value pairs:

- `reservation_id` (UUID, optional): unique identifier for an entire car share reservation, tied across multiple journeys and therefore trips.

[Top][toc]

### Trip ID Requirements

Events require a valid `trip_id` in events where `event_types` contains `reservation_start`, `reservation_stop`, `trip_start`, `trip_stop`, `trip_end`, `passenger_cancellation`, `provider_cancellation`. 

Additionally, `trip_id` is required if `event_types` contains a `enter_jurisdiction` or `leave_jurisdiction` event pertaining to a trip. 

[Top][toc]

### Trip Type

The `trip_type` field **must** have one of the following enumerated values:

- `private`: a private trip made by one paying customer with one or more guests
- `reservation`: en route to pickup a customer who has made a reservation, with no passengers in the vehicle
- `empty`: vehicle movement with no customer (outside of other `trip_type` values) that may need to be reported, e.g. for maintenance

[Top][toc]

### Trip Attributes

The `trip_attributes` array **may** have the following key value pairs:

- `hail_type` (enumerated, required): `phone_dispatch`, `phone`, `text`, `app`
- `app_name` (text, optional): name of the app used to reserve the trip which could be provider's app or 3rd party app
- `permit_licence_number` (string, optional) - The permit licence number of the organization that dispatched the vehicle
- `driver_id` (string, optional): Universal identifier of a specific driver, static across operators, like a driver's license number, for company employees in `reservation` or `empty` trip types, not `private` trips. Could also be used as a lookup in an agency's internal driver system.

_See more available trip attributes for any mode in the [trips endpoint](/provider#trips)._

### Fare Attributes

The `fare_attributes` array **may** have the following key value pairs:

- `payment_type` (enumerated, required): `cash`, `credit_card`, `mobile`, `voucher`, `no payment`, `test`
- `fare_type` (enumerated, required): `meter_fare`, `upfront_pricing`, `flat_rate`. Indicator of which rate was charged.
- `tolls` (currency, optional) - Sum of any and all tolls charged for the trip, such as bridge tolls
- `base_rate` (currency, optional) - Minimum fare to be charged as soon as the trip starts.
- `exit_fee` (currency, optional) - Fee to exit location, like an airport
- `other_fees` (currency, optional) - amount of any fees charged to the customer. Includes baggage fees, cleaning fee. Excludes other fees returned.
