## Background

The Geography Author service is intended to define the write endpoints relevant to Geographies. Read-only endpoints are covered in the Geography service. This service is also intended to provide a specification for managing GeographyMetadata. For more background information, see the Geography spec.

## Scoping and how it relates to Geography status

Since an unpublished Geography may not be ready for viewing by a broader audience, unlike published geographies, it requires a narrower audience. The Geography Author Service must implement two read scopes: `geographies:read:published` and `geographies:read:unpublished`. The `geographies:read:unpublished` scope is meant to supersede the `geographies:read:published` scope. A user that has only the `geographies:read:published` scope must be restricted to reading only published geographies. A user that has the `geographies:read:unpublished` scope should be able to read both published and unpublished geographies. GeographyMetada is likewise restricted.

### Geography Fields

| Name             | Type      | R/O | Description                                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`           | String    | R   | Name of geography                                                                      |
| `description`    | String    | O   | Detailed description of geography                                                                      |
| `geography_id`   | UUID      | R   | Unique ID of geography                                                                 |
| `geography_json`   | UUID      | R   | The GeoJSON FeatureCollection that defines the geospatial area.
| `effective_date`   | timestamp | O   | `start_date` for first published policy that uses this geo.  Server should set this when policies are published.  This may be used on the client to distinguish between “logical” geographies that have the same name. E.g. if a policy publishes a geography on 5/1/2020, and then another policy is published which references that same geography is published on 4/1/2020, the effective_date will be set to 4/1/2020.
| `publish_date`   | timestamp | R   | Timestamp that the policy was published, i.e. made immutable                                             |
| `prev_geographies`  | UUID[]    | O   | Unique IDs of prior geographies replaced by this one                                   |

### GeographyMetadata Fields

| Name             | Type      | R/O | Description                                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `geography_id`   | UUID      | R   | Unique ID of geography                                                                 |
| `geography_metadata`   | JSON    | R   | An JSON blob that stores arbitrary data about the geography referenced. Keys must be strings.

<a name="file-format"></a>

## File format

To use flat files rather than REST endpoints, Geography objects should be stored in `geographies.json`.  The `geographies.json` file will look like the output of `GET /geographies`.  Examples are as follows:

```

Example `geographies.json`
```
{
    "version": "0.4.0",
    "updated:" "1570035222868",
    "geographies": [
        {
            // GeoJSON 1
        },
        {
            // GeoJSON 2
        }
    ]
}
```
```


_Note: A simple tool to validate `geographies.json` will be contributed to the Open Mobility Foundation._

<a name="endpoints"></a>

## REST Endpoints

Responses must set the `Content-Type` header, as specified in the [Provider versioning](../provider/README.md#versioning) section. They must also specify the API version in the JSON-formatted response body, under the `version` key.

The Geography Author API consists of the following endpoints:


### POST /geographies
To create a geography, POST a Geography in the request body to `/geographies`.

Response codes:
- 201 - success
- 401 - unauthorized
- 409 - a Geography with the same UUID already exists on the server`

### PUT /geographies/:geography_id
#### Path Parameters

| Name          | Type                                                          | R/O | Description                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| geography_id | [UUID](../common/DataDefinitions.md#unique-identifiers-uuids) | R   | Unique identifier for a single specific Geography. |

#### Body Parameters
Submit a Geography object in the body of the request.

Response codes:
- 201 - success
- 401 - unauthorized
- 404 - no Geography with this UUID was found on the server

### DELETE /geographies/:geography_id
This will automatically delete any associated metadata as well.
#### Path Parameters

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --------------------------------------------------- |

Response codes:
- 201 - success
- 401 - unauthorized
- 404 - no Geography with this UUID was found on the server

### GET /geographies/:geography_id/meta
Returns a GeographyMetadata object.

#### Path Parameters

| Name          | Type                                                          | R/O | Description                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| geography_id | [UUID](../common/DataDefinitions.md#unique-identifiers-uuids) | R   | Unique identifier for a single specific Geography. |

Response body format:
```js
{
  version: '0.1.0',
  geography_metadata: {
    geography_id: UUID,
    geography_metadata: JSON
  } 
}
```

Response codes:
- 200 - success
- 401 - unauthorized
- 403 - user lacking `geographies:read:unpublished` attempted to read an unpublished Geography's metadata
- 404 - no Geography with this UUID was found on the server

### GET /geographies/meta
This behaves just like `GET /geographies`.

#### Query String Parameters

| Name         | Type      | R/O | Description                                    |
| ------------ | --------- | --- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `get_published` | string | O   | Filter for published geography's metadata.  |
| `get_unpublished`   | string | O   | Filter for unpublished geography's metadata      |

Response codes:
- 200 - success
- 400 - bad query (most likely both `get_published` and `get_unpublished` were both set)
- 401 - unauthorized
- 403 - user lacking `geographies:read:unpublished` attempted to read an unpublished Geography's metadata
- 404 - no Geography with this UUID was found on the server

### PUT /geographies/:geography_id/meta
Create or edit a geography metadata. The metadata must be in the request body.

Response codes:
- 201 - success
- 401 - unauthorized
- 404 - no Geography with this UUID was found on the server, metadata cannot be written
