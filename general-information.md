## Beta Features

In some cases, features within MDS may be marked as "beta." These are typically recently added endpoints or fields. Because beta features are new, they may not yet be fully mature and proven in real-world operation. The design of beta features may have undiscovered gaps, ambiguities, or inconsistencies. Implementations of those features are typically also quite new and are more likely to contain bugs or other flaws. Beta features are likely to evolve more rapidly than other parts of the specification.

Despite this, MDS users are highly encouraged to use beta features. New features can only become proven and trusted through implementation, use, and the learning that comes with it. Users should be thoughtful about the role of beta features in their operations. Users of beta features are strongly encouraged to share their experiences, learnings, and challenges with the broader MDS community via GitHub issues or pull requests. This will inform the refinements that transform beta features into fully proven, stable parts of the specification. You may leave feedback on the appropriate open [feedback issue](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeta) tagged with the `beta` label.

Beta features may be suitable for enabling some new tools and analysis, but may not be appropriate for mission-critical applications or regulatory decisions where certainty and reliability are essential. In subsequent releases existing beta features may include breaking changes, even in a minor release. Note that [schemas](/schema) may not be defined for some beta features until they are promoted out of beta.

Working Groups and their Steering Committees are expected to review beta designated features and [feedback](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeta) with each release cycle and determine whether the feature has reached the level of stability and maturity needed to remove the beta designation. In a case where a beta feature fails to reach substantial adoption after an extended time, Working Group Steering Committees should discuss whether or not the feature should remain in the specification.

## Costs and currencies

Fields specifying a monetary cost use a currency as specified in [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes). All costs should be given as integers in the currency's smallest unit. As an example, to represent $1 USD, specify an amount of `100` (100 cents).

If the currency field is null, USD cents is implied.

## Definitions

Defining terminology and abbreviations used throughout MDS.

* **API** - Application Programming Interface - A function or set of functions that allow one software application to access or communicate with features of a different software application or service.
* **API Endpoint** - A point at which an API connects with a software application or service.
* **DOT** - Department of Transportation, usually a city-run agency.
* **Jurisdiction** - An agency’s area of legal authority to manage and regulate a mobility program in the real world. Note there is also an MDS API called [Jurisdiction](/jurisdiction), which is a way to digitally represent this.
* **PROW** - Public Right of Way - the physical infrastructure reserved for transportation purposes, examples include sidewalks, curbs, bike lanes, transit lanes and stations, traffic lanes and signals, and public parking.

[Top][toc]

## Devices

MDS defines the *device* as the unit that transmits GPS or GNSS signals for a particular vehicle. A given device must have a UUID (`device_id` below) that is unique within the Provider's fleet.

Additionally, `device_id` must remain constant for the device's lifetime of service, regardless of the vehicle components that house the device.

[Top][toc]

## Geographic Data

References to geographic datatypes (Point, MultiPolygon, etc.) imply coordinates encoded in the [WGS 84 (EPSG:4326)][wgs84] standard GPS or GNSS projection expressed as [Decimal Degrees][decimal-degrees]. When points are used, you may assume a 20 meter buffer around the point when needed.

### Geographic Telemetry Data

Whenever a vehicle location coordinate measurement is presented, it must be represented as a GeoJSON [`Feature`][geojson-feature] object with a corresponding `properties` object with the following properties:


| Field          | Type            | Required/Optional     | Field Description                                            |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `timestamp`    | [timestamp][ts] | Required              | Date/time that event occurred. Based on GPS or GNSS clock |
| `altitude`     | Double          | Required if Available | Altitude above mean sea level in meters |
| `heading`      | Double          | Required if Available | Degrees - clockwise starting at 0 degrees at true North |
| `speed`        | Float           | Required if Available | Estimated speed in meters / sec as reported by the GPS chipset |
| `accuracy`     | Float           | Required if Available | Horizontal accuracy, in meters |
| `hdop`         | Float           | Required if Available | Horizontal GPS or GNSS accuracy value (see [hdop][hdop]) |
| `satellites`   | Integer         | Required if Available | Number of GPS or GNSS satellites |

Example of a vehicle location GeoJSON [`Feature`][geojson-feature] object:

```json
{
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "timestamp": 1529968782421,
        "accuracy": 10,
        "speed": 1.21
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
            -118.46710503101347,
            33.9909333514159
        ]
    }
}
```

### Stop-based Geographic Data

When an individual location coordinate measurement (Point) corresponds to a [Stop][general-stops], it must be presented with a `stop_id` property:

```json
{
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "timestamp": 1529968782421,
        "stop_id": "b813cde2-a41c-4ae3-b409-72ff221e003d"
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
            -118.46710503101347,
            33.9909333514159
        ]
    }
}
```

### Intersection Operation

For the purposes of this specification, the intersection of two geographic datatypes is defined according to the [`ST_Intersects` PostGIS operation][st-intersects]

> If a geometry or geography shares any portion of space then they intersect. For geography -- tolerance is 0.00001 meters (so any points that are close are considered to intersect).
>
> Overlaps, Touches, Within all imply spatial intersection. If any of the aforementioned returns true, then the geometries also spatially intersect. Disjoint implies false for spatial intersection.

## Geography-Driven Events

**[Beta feature](/general-information.md#beta-features):** *Yes (as of 1.1.0)*. [Leave feedback](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/670)  

Geography-Driven Events (GDE) is a new MDS feature for Agencies to perform complete Policy compliance monitoring without precise location data. Geography-Driven Events describe individual vehicles in realtime – not just aggregate data. However, rather than receiving the exact location of a vehicle, Agencies receive information about the vehicle's current geographic region. The regions used for Geography-Driven Events correspond to the Geographies in an Agency's current Policy. In this way, the data-shared using Geography-Driven Events is matched to an Agency's particular regulatory needs. 

See [this example](/policy/examples/requirements.md#geography-driven-events) for how to implement GDE using [Policy Requirements](/policy#requirement).

Here's how it works in practice:

1. The Agency creates a geographic Policy Area for a local regulatory need

	*Scooters traveling within downtown during peak hours incur a $0.20 fee.*

2. Providers notify the Agency in real-time about events in the Policy Area.

	*At 5:21pm scooter X7123 entered downtown.*

3. The Agency can refine their data needs over time by revising their published Policy Areas.

	*Agency adds rule disallowing parking on waterfront path, begins receiving data on events within area.*

Agencies that wish to use Geography-Driven Events do so by requiring a new `event_geographies` field in status events. When an Agency is using Geography-Driven Events, Providers must emit a new `changed_geographies` status event whenever a vehicle in a trip enters or leaves a Geography managed by a Policy. 

During the Beta period for this feature, location and telemetry data remain required fields. This allows Agencies to test Geography-Driven Events, measuring its accuracy and efficacy against regulatory systems based on precise location data. After the beta period, if Geography-Driven Events is deemed by the OMF to be accurate and effective, the specification will evolve to allow cities to use Geography-Driven Events in lieu of location or telemetry data.

[Top][toc]

## Optional Authentication

Authorization of the Policy and Geography APIs is no longer required and will be deprecated in next major release with these endpoints (plus Jursidictions) becoming 'optionally private' instead of 'optionally public'. An agency may optionally decide to make the Policy and Geography endpoints, as well as Jursidictions, unauthenticated and public. This allows transparency for the public to see how the city is regulating, holds the city accountable for their policy decisions, and reduces the technical burden on providers to use these endpoints. A side benefit is that this allows third parties to ingest this information into their applications and services for public benefit.

Note if implementing the beta feature [Geography Driven Events](/general-information.md#geography-driven-events), both Policy and Geography must be public.

[Top][toc]

## Stops

Stops describe vehicle trip start and end locations in a pre-designated physical place. They can vary from docking stations with or without charging, corrals with lock-to railings, or suggested parking areas marked with spray paint. Stops are used in both [Provider](/provider#stops) (including routes and event locations) and [Agency](/agency#stops) (including telemetry data).

  "is_renting": false,
  "is_returning": true
}
```

### GBFS Compatibility

Some of the fields in the `Stops` definition are using notions which are currently not in MDS, such as `rental_methods`. These fields are included for compatibility with GBFS.

[Top][toc]

## Timestamps

A `timestamp` refers to integer milliseconds since Unix epoch.

[Top][toc]

## UUIDs

Object identifiers are described via Universally Unique Identifiers [(UUIDs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). For example, the `device_id` field used to uniquely identify a vehicle is a UUID.

MDS uses Version 1 UUIDs by default. Version 4 UUIDs may be used where noted.

## Vehicle Characteristics

Properties and characteristics of vehicles and devices.

[Top][toc]

### Accessibility Options
This enum represents the accessibility options available on a given vehicle, or the accessibility options utilized for a given trip. Optional and applicable only to certain [modes][modes].

| `accessibility_option`  | Description                           |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `wheelchair_accessible` | This vehicle is wheelchair accessible |

[Top][toc]

### Propulsion Types

| `propulsion`      | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `human`           | Pedal or foot propulsion                               |
| `electric_assist` | Provides power only alongside human propulsion         |
| `electric`        | Contains throttle mode with a battery-powered motor    |
| `combustion`      | Contains throttle mode with a gas engine-powered motor |

A vehicle may have one or more values from the `propulsion`, depending on the number of modes of operation. For example, a scooter that can be powered by foot or by electric motor would have the `propulsion` represented by the array `['human', 'electric']`. A bicycle with pedal-assist would have the `propulsion` represented by the array `['human', 'electric_assist']` if it can also be operated as a traditional bicycle.

[Top][toc]

### Vehicle Types

The list of allowed `vehicle_type` values in MDS. Aligning with [GBFS vehicle types form factors](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md#vehicle_typesjson-added-in-v21-rc).

| `vehicle_type` | Description |
|----------------| ----------- |
| bicycle        | A two-wheeled mobility device intended for personal transportation that can be operated via pedals, with or without a motorized assist (includes e-bikes, recumbents, and tandems) |
| cargo_bicycle  | A two- or three-wheeled bicycle intended for transporting larger, heavier cargo than a standard bicycle (such as goods or passengers), with or without motorized assist (includes bakfiets/front-loaders, cargo trikes, and long-tails) |
| car            | A passenger car or similar light-duty vehicle |
| scooter        | A standing or seated fully-motorized mobility device intended for one rider, capable of travel at low or moderate speeds, and suited for operation in infrastructure shared with motorized bicycles |
| moped          | A seated fully-motorized mobility device capable of travel at moderate or high speeds and suited for operation in general urban traffic |
| other          | A device that does not fit in the other categories |

[Top][toc]

## Versioning

MDS APIs must handle requests for specific versions of the specification from clients.

Versioning must be implemented through the use of a custom media-type, `application/vnd.mds+json`, combined with a required `version` parameter.

The version parameter specifies the dot-separated combination of major and minor versions from a published version of the specification. For example, the media-type for version `1.0.1` would be specified as `application/vnd.mds+json;version=1.0`

Clients must specify the version they are targeting through the `Accept` header. For example:

```http
Accept: application/vnd.mds+json;version=1.2.0
```

Since versioning was not available from the start, the following APIs provide a fallback version if the `Accept` header is not set as specified above:

* The `provider` API must respond as if version `0.2` was requested.
* The `agency` API must respond as if version `0.3` was requested.
* The `policy` API must respond as if version `0.4` was requested.

If an unsupported or invalid version is requested, the API must respond with a status of `406 Not Acceptable`.
