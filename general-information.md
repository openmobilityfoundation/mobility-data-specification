# Mobility Data Specification: **General information**

This document contains specifications that are shared between the various MDS APIs such as `agency`, `provider` and `policy`.

## Versioning

MDS APIs must handle requests for specific versions of the specification from clients.

Versioning must be implemented through the use of a custom media-type, `application/vnd.mds.provider+json`, combined with a required `version` parameter.

The version parameter specifies the dot-separated combination of major and minor versions from a published version of the specification. For example, the media-type for version `0.2.1` would be specified as `application/vnd.mds.provider+json;version=0.2`

> Note: Normally breaking changes are covered by different major versions in semver notation. However, as this specification is still pre-1.0.0, changes in minor versions may include breaking changes, and therefore are included in the version string.

Clients must specify the version they are targeting through the `Accept` header. For example:

```http
Accept: application/vnd.mds.provider+json;version=0.3
```

> Since versioning was not available from the start, the following APIs provide a fallback version if the `Accept` header is not set as specified above:
> - The `provider` API must respond as if version `0.2` was requested.
> - The `agency` API must respond as if version `0.3` was requested.
> - The `policy` API must respond as if version `0.4` was requested.

If an unsupported or invalid version is requested, the API must respond with a status of `406 Not Acceptable`. If this occurs, a client can explicitly negotiate available versions.

A client negotiates available versions using the `OPTIONS` method to an MDS endpoint. For example, to check if `trips` supports either version `0.2` or `0.3` with a preference for `0.2`, the client would issue the following request:

```http
OPTIONS /trips/ HTTP/1.1
Host: provider.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.mds.provider+json;version=0.2,application/vnd.mds.provider+json;version=0.3;q=0.9
```

The response will include the most preferred supported version in the `Content-Type` header. For example, if only `0.3` is supported:

```http
Content-Type: application/vnd.mds.provider+json;version=0.3
```

The client can use the returned value verbatim as a version request in the `Accept` header.
