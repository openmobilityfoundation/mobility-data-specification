# About

The Mobility Data Specification (**MDS**), a project of the [Open Mobility Foundation](http://www.openmobilityfoundation.org) (**OMF**), is a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that helps cities better manage transportation in the public right of way, standardizing communication and data-sharing between cities and mobility providers, allowing cities to share and validate policy digitally, and enabling vehicle management and better outcomes for residents. Inspired in part by projects like [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/) and [GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs), MDS is focused on managing mobility services such as dockless scooters, bicycles, mopeds, car share, delivery robots, and passenger services. 

**MDS** is a key piece of digital infrastructure that supports the effective implementation of mobility policies in cities around the world. For a high level overview and visuals, see the [About MDS](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/about-mds/) page on the OMF website.

**MDS** is an open-source project originally created by the [Los Angeles Department of Transportation](http://ladot.io) (LADOT). In November 2019, stewardship of MDS and the ownership of this repository were transferred to the [Open Mobility Foundation](http://www.openmobilityfoundation.org). GitHub automatically redirects any links to this repository from the `CityOfLosAngeles` organization to the `openmobilityfoundation` instead. MDS continues to be used by LADOT and [many other municipalities](#cities-using-mds) and companies.

# Endpoints

**MDS** is comprised of six distinct APIs, with multiple endpoints under each API:

<a href="/provider/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yzXrKpo.png" width="80" align="left" alt="MDS Provider Icon" border="0"></a>

The [`provider`][provider] API endpoints are intended to be implemented by mobility providers and consumed by regulatory agencies. When a municipality queries information from a mobility provider, the Provider API has a historical view of operations in a standard format. It was first released in June 2018. 

---

<a href="/agency/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HzMWtaI.png" width="80" align="left" alt="MDS Agency Icon" border="0"></a>

The [`agency`][agency] API endpoints are intended to be implemented by regulatory agencies and consumed by mobility providers. Providers query the Agency API when events (such as a trip start or vehicle status change) occur in their systems. It was first released in April 2019. 

---

<a href="/policy/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/66QXveN.png" width="80" align="left" alt="MDS Policy Icon" border="0"></a>

The [`policy`][policy] API endpoints are intended to be implemented by regulatory agencies and consumed by mobility providers. Providers query the Policy API to get information about local rules that may affect the operation of their mobility service or which may be used to determine compliance. It was first released in October 2019.

---

<a href="/geography/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JJdKX8b.png" width="80" align="left" alt="MDS Geography Icon" border="0"></a>

The [`geography`][geography] API endpoints are intended to be implemented by regulatory agencies and consumed by mobility providers. Providers query the Policy API to get information about geographical regions for regulatory and other purposes. It was first released in October 2019, originally included as part of the Policy specification. 

---

<a href="/jurisdiction/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tCRCfxT.png" width="80" align="left" alt="MDS Jurisdiction Icon" border="0"></a>

The [`jurisdiction`][jurisdiction] API endpoints are intended to be implemented by regulatory agencies that have a need to coordinate with each other. The jurisdiction endpoints allow cities to communicate boundaries between one another and to mobility providers. It was first released in March 2021. 

---

<a href="/metrics/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ouijHLj.png" width="80" align="left" alt="MDS Metrics Icon" border="0"></a>

The [`metrics`](/metrics) API endpoints are intended to be implemented by regulatory agencies or their appointed third-party representatives to have a standard way to consistently describe available metrics, and create an extensible interface for querying MDS metrics. It was first released in March 2021. 

---

## Modularity

MDS is designed to be a modular kit-of-parts. Regulatory agencies can use the components of the API that are appropriate for their needs. An agency may choose to use only `agency`, `provider`, or `policy`. Other APIs like `geography`, `jurisdiction`, and `metrics` can be used in coordination as described with these APIs or sometimes on their own. Or agencies may select specific elements (endpoints) from each API to help them implement their goals. Development of the APIs takes place under the guidance of the OMF's [MDS Working Group](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/wiki/MDS-Working-Group).

Many parts of the MDS definitions and APIs align across each other. In these cases, consolidated information can be found on the [General Information](/general-information.md) page.

You can read more in our **[Understanding the different MDS APIs](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/blob/main/technical/Understanding-MDS-APIs.md)** guide.

## GBFS Requirement

All MDS compatible Provider feeds [must also expose](/provider/README.md#gbfs) a public [GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs) feed. Compatibility with [GBFS 2.0](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/v2.0/gbfs.md) or greater is advised due to privacy concerns and support for micromobility. See our [MDS Vehicles Guide](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/wiki/MDS-Vehicles) for how MDS Provider `/vehicles` can be used by regulators instead of the public GBFS `/free_bike_status`. Additional information on MDS and GBFS can be found in this [guidance document](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/blob/main/technical/GBFS_and_MDS.md).

# Modes

MDS supports multiple "modes", defined as a distinct regulatory framework for a type of mobility service. See the [modes overview](/modes) or get started with a specific mode:

- **[Micromobility](/modes/micromobility.md)** - dockless or docked small devices such as e-scooters and bikes.
- **[Passenger services](/modes/passenger-services.md)** - transporting individuals with a vehicle driven by another entity, including taxis, TNCs, and microtransit
- **[Car share](/modes/car-share.md)** - shared point-to-point and station-based mutli-passenger vehicles.
- **[Delivery robots](/modes/delivery-robots.md)** - autonomous and remotely driven goods delivery devices

# Data Privacy

MDS includes information about vehicles, their location, and trips taken on those vehicles to allow agencies to regulate their use in the public right of way and to conduct transportation planning and analysis. While MDS is not designed to convey personal information about the users of shared mobility services, data collected about mobility can be sensitive. The OMF and MDS community have created a number of resources to help cities, mobility providers, and software companies handle vehicle data safely:

* [MDS Privacy Guide for Cities](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/raw/main/documents/OMF-MDS-Privacy-Guide-for-Cities.pdf) - guide that covers essential privacy topics and best practices
* [The Privacy Principles for Mobility Data](https://www.mobilitydataprivacyprinciples.org/) - principles endorsed by the OMF and other mobility organizations to guide the mobility ecosystem in the responsible use of data and the protection of individual privacy
* [Mobility Data State of Practice](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/privacy-committee/blob/main/products/state-of-the-practice.md) -  real-world examples related to the handling and protection of MDS and other types of mobility data
* [Understanding the Data in MDS](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/wiki/Understanding-the-Data-in-MDS) - technical document outlining what data is (and is not) in MDS
* [Use Case Database](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/whats-possible-with-mds/) - a starting point for understanding how MDS can be used, and what parts of MDS is required to meet those use cases
* [Policy Requirements](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/tree/main/policy#requirement) - built into MDS, allowing agencies to specify only the endpoints and fields needed for program regulation
* [Using MDS Under GDPR](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/using-mds-under-gdpr/) - how to use MDS in the context of GDPR in Europe

The OMF’s [Privacy, Security, and Transparency Committee](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/privacy-committee#welcome-to-the-privacy-security-and-transparency-committee) creates many of these resources, and advises the OMF on principles and practices that ensure the secure handling of mobility data. The committee – which is composed of both private and public sector OMF members – also holds regular public meetings, which provide additional resources and an opportunity to discuss issues related to privacy and mobility data. Learn more [here](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/privacy-committee#welcome-to-the-privacy-security-and-transparency-committee).

# Use Cases

How cities use MDS depends on a variety of factors: their transportation goals, existing services and infrastructure, and the unique needs of their communities. Cities are using MDS to create policy, enforce rules, manage hundreds of devices, and ensure the safe operation of vehicles in the public right of way. Some examples of how cities are using MDS in practice are:

- **Vehicle Caps:** Determine total number of vehicles per operator in the right of way
- **Distribution Requirements:** Ensure vehicles are distributed according to equity requirements
- **Injury Investigation:** Investigate injuries and collisions with other objects and cars to determine roadway accident causes
- **Restricted Area Rides:** Find locations where vehicles are operating or passing through restricted areas
- **Resident Complaints:** Investigate and validate complaints from residents about operations, parking, riding, speed, etc, usually reported through 311
- **Infrastructure Planning:** Determine where to place new bike/scooter lanes and drop zones based on usage and demand, start and end points, and trips taken

A list of use cases is useful to show what's possible with MDS, to list what other cities are accomplishing with the data, to see many use cases up front for privacy considerations, and to use for policy discussions and policy language. More details and examples can be seen on the [OMF website](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/whats-possible-with-mds/) and our [Wiki Database](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/wiki/MDS-Use-Cases).

Please [let us know](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrMPgeb1TKMYCjjKsJh3y1TPTJO8HR_y1NByrf1rDmTEJS7Q/viewform) if you have recommended updates or use cases to add.

# Related Projects

Community projects are those efforts by individual contributors or informal groups that take place outside Open Mobility Foundation’s formalized process, complementing MDS. These related projects often push new ideas forward through experimental or locally-focused development, and are an important part of a thriving open source community. Some of these projects may eventually be contributed to and managed by the Open Mobility Foundation.

The OMF's [Communitiy Projects](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/community-projects/) page has an every growing list of projects related to MDS, and see our [Privacy Committee's State of Practice](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/privacy-committee/blob/main/products/state-of-the-practice.md) for more examples.

Please [let us know](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/get-in-touch/) if you create open source or private tools for implementing or working with MDS data.
