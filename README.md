# Mobility Data Specification

A data standard and API specification for *mobility as a service* providers, such as Dockless Bikeshare, E-Scooters, and Shared Ride providers who work within the public right of way.

Inspired by [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/) and [GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs). Specifically, the goals of the Mobility Data Specification (**MDS**) are to provide API and data standards for municipalities to help ingest, compare and analyze *mobility as a service* provider data. 

The specification is a way to implement realtime data sharing, measurement and regulation for municipalities and *mobility as a service* providers. It is meant to ensure that governments have the ability to enforce, evaluate and manage providers. 

**MDS** is currently comprised of two distinct components:

* The [`provider`][provider] API is to be implemented by *mobility as a service* providers, for data exchange and operational information that a municipality will query.

* The [`agency`][agency] API is to be implemented by *municipalities* and other regulatory agencies, for providers to query and integrate with during operations.

At the onset of the program, [`provider`][provider] will be required, with phasing to [`agency`][agency] at a time to be announced.

The rules and guidelines can be found on [Council Clerk Connect](https://cityclerk.lacity.org/lacityclerkconnect/index.cfm?fa=ccfi.viewrecord&cfnumber=17-1125).

The specification will be versioned using Git tags and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). See the list of [releases](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification/releases) for more information.
