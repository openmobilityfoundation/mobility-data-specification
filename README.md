# Mobility Data Specification

The Mobility Data Specification (**MDS**), a project of the [Open Mobility Foundation](http://www.openmobilityfoundation.org) (OMF), is a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) focused on dockless e-scooters, bicycles and carshare. Inspired by projects like [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/) and [GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs), the goals of MDS are to provide a standardized way for municipalities or other regulatory agencies to ingest, compare and analyze data from mobility service providers, and to give municipalities the ability to express regulation in machine-readable formats.

**MDS** helps cities interact with companies who operate dockless scooters, bicycles and carshare in the public right-of-way. MDS is a key piece of digital infrastructure that supports the effective implementation of mobility policies in cities around the world.

**MDS** is an open-source project. It was originally created by the [Los Angeles Department of Transportation](http://ladot.io) (LADOT). In November 2019, stewardship of MDS and the ownership of this repository was transferred to the Open Mobility Foundation. GitHub automatically redirects any links to this repository in the `CityOfLosAngeles` organization to the `openmobilityfoundation` instead. MDS continues to be used by LADOT and many other municipalities.

**MDS** is currently comprised of three distinct components:

* The [`provider`][provider] API endpoints are intended to be implemented by mobility providers and consumed by regulatory agencies. When a municipality queries information from a mobility provider, the Provider API has a historical view of operations in a standard format. It was first released in June 2018. Development takes place under the guidance of the OMF's Provider Services Working Group.

* The [`agency`][agency] API endpoints are intended to be implemented by regulatory agencies and consumed by mobility providers. Providers query the Agency API when events (such as a trip start or vehicle status change) occur in their systems. It was first released in April 2019. Development takes place under the guidance of the OMF's City Services Working Group.

* The [`policy`][policy] API endpoints are intended to be implemented by regulatory agencies and consumed by mobility providers. Providers query the Policy API to get information about local rules that may affect the operation of their mobility service or which may be used to determine compliance. It was first released in October 2019. Development takes place under the guidance of the OMF's City Services Working Group.

MDS is designed to be a modular kit-of-parts. Regulatory agencies can use the components of the API that are appropriate for their needs. An agency may choose to use only `agency`, `provider`, or `policy`. Or they may select specific elements (endpoints) from each to help them implement their goals.

You can also get involved in development by joining an OMF working group. The working groups maintain the OMF GitHub repositories and work through issues and pull requests. Each working group has its own mailing list for non-technical discussion and planning:

Working Group | Mailing List | Description
--- | --- | ---
Provider Services | [mds-provider-services](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.openmobilityfoundation.org/forum/#!forum/mds-provider-services) | Manages the [`provider`][provider] API within MDS.
City Services | [mds-city-services](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.openmobilityfoundation.org/forum/#!forum/mds-city-services) | Manages the [`agency`][agency] and [`policy`][policy] APIs within MDS, as well as the [`mds-core`](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mds-core) reference implementation.

## Cities Using MDS

More than 80 cities and public agencies around the world use MDS, and it has been implemented by most major mobility providers. Below are links to some specific agency programs/policies:

* Los Angeles: The rules and guidelines for the Los Angeles Dockless Bikeshare Systems / Pilot Program can be found on [Council Clerk Connect](https://cityclerk.lacity.org/lacityclerkconnect/index.cfm?fa=ccfi.viewrecord&cfnumber=17-1125) along with supporting info on [ladot.io](https://ladot.io/programs/dockless/).
* Santa Monica: The rules and guidelines for the Santa Monica Shared Mobility Pilot Program can be found at https://www.smgov.net/sharedmobility.
* Austin: The rules and guidelines for Austin's Micromobility Program can be found at https://austintexas.gov/micromobility.
* Ulm: A draft of the guidelines can be found at [the city's GitHub presence](https://github.com/stadtulm/mds-zonen).

## Use Cases
Some examples of how cities are using MDS in practice:

- Verify how many scooters are operating.
- Verify whether scooters are being deployed equitably across neighborhoods.
- Determine whether scooters are dropped off outside of a service area.
- Determine whether scooters are being parked in safe and appropriate parking areas.
- Ensure compliance with device caps and operating regulations.
- Ensure inform and help manage 311 / Service Request style operations.
- Inform future capital investments such as dockless vehicle drop zones or furniture zones.
- Inform infrastructure planning efforts such as the addition of bike lanes or street redesigns.
- Provide visibility into the relationship between micromobility and other modes, such as public transit
- Inform micromobility policy making â€“ number of scooters, distribution, etc.
- Develop ways to communicate dynamic information on unplanned events, such as emergency road closures, water main breaks, etc. to mobility providers to help them keep their users and contractors informed for better route planning and re-balancing efforts.
