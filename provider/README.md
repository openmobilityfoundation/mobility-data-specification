# Mobility Data Specification: **Provider**

This specification contains a data standard for *mobility as a service* providers to define a RESTful API for municipalities to access on-demand.

## Table of Contents

* [General Information](#general-information)
* [Trips](#trips)
* [Status Changes](#status-changes)
* [Realtime Data](#realtime-data)

## General Information

The following information applies to all `provider` API endpoints. Details on providing authorization to endpoints is specified in the [auth](auth.md) document.

### Versioning

`provider` APIs must handle requests for specific versions of the specification from clients. 

Versioning must be implemented through the use of a custom media-type, `application/vnd.mds.provider+json`, combined with a required `version` parameter.

The version parameter specifies the dot-separated combination of major and minor versions from a published version of the specification. For example, the media-type for version `0.2.1` would be specified as `application/vnd.mds.provider+json;version=0.2`

> Note: Normally breaking changes are covered by different major versions in semver notation. However, as this specification is still pre-1.0.0, changes in minor versions may include breaking changes, and therefore are included in the version string.

Clients must specify the version they are targeting through the `Accept` header. For example:

```http
Accept: application/vnd.mds.provider+json;version=0.3
```

> Since versioning was not added until the 0.3.0 release, if the `Accept` header is `application/json` or not set in the request, the `provider` API must respond as if version `0.2` was requested.

Responses to client requests must indicate the version the response adheres to through the `Content-Type` header. For example:

```http
Content-Type: application/vnd.mds.provider+json;version=0.3
```

> Since versioning was not added until the 0.3.0 release, if the `Content-Type` header is `application/json` or not set in the response, version `0.2` must be assumed.

If an unsupported or invalid version is requested, the API must respond with a status of `406 Not Acceptable`. If this occurs, a client can explicitly negotiate available versions.

A client negotiates available versions using the `OPTIONS` method to an MDS endpoint. For example, to check if `trips` supports either version `0.2` or `0.3` with a preference for `0.2`, the client would issue the following request:

```http
OPTIONS /trips/ HTTP/1.1 
Host: provider.example.com 
Accept: application/vnd.mds.provider+json;version=0.2,application/vnd.mds.provider+json;version=0.3;q=0.9
```

The response will include the most preferred supported version in the `Content-Type` header. For example, if only `0.3` is supported:

```http
Content-Type: application/vnd.mds.provider+json;version=0.3
```

The client can use the returned value verbatim as a version request in the `Accept` header.

### Response Format

The response to a client request must include a valid HTTP status code defined in the [IANA HTTP Status Code Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml). It also must set the `Content-Type` header, as specified in the [Versioning](#Versioning) section.

Response bodies must be a `UTF-8` encoded JSON object and must minimally include the MDS `version` and a `data` payload:

```json
{
    "version": "x.y.z",
    "data": {
        "trips": [{
            "provider_id": "...",
            "trip_id": "...",
        }]
    }
}
```

All response fields must use `lower_case_with_underscores`.

#### JSON Schema

MDS defines [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) files for [`trips`][trips-schema] and [`status_changes`][sc-schema].

`provider` API responses must validate against their respective schema files. The schema files always take precedence over the language and examples in this and other supporting documentation meant for *human* consumption.

### Pagination

`provider` APIs may decide to paginate the data payload. If so, pagination must comply with the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination) specification.

The following keys must be used for pagination links:

* `first`: url to the first page of data
* `last`: url to the last page of data
* `prev`: url to the previous page of data
* `next`: url to the next page of data

At a minimum, paginated payloads must include a `next` key, which must be set to `null` to indicate the last page of data. 

```json
{
    "version": "x.y.z",
    "data": {
        "trips": [{
            "provider_id": "...",
            "trip_id": "...",
        }]
    },
    "links": {
        "first": "https://...",
        "last": "https://...",
        "prev": "https://...",
        "next": "https://..."
    }
}
```

### UUIDs for Devices

MDS defines the *device* as the unit that transmits GPS or GNSS signals for a particular vehicle. A given device must have a UUID (`device_id` below) that is unique within the Provider's fleet.

Additionally, `device_id` must remain constant for the device's lifetime of service, regardless of the vehicle components that house the device.

### Geographic Data

References to geographic datatypes (Point, MultiPolygon, etc.) imply coordinates encoded in the [WGS 84 (EPSG:4326)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) standard GPS or GNSS projection expressed as [Decimal Degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees).

Whenever an individual location coordinate measurement is presented, it must be
represented as a GeoJSON [`Feature`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2) object with a corresponding [`timestamp`][ts] property and [`Point`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.2) geometry:

```json
{
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "timestamp": 1529968782421
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
            -118.46710503101347,
            33.9909333514159
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Intersection Operation
For the purposes of this specification, the intersection of two geographic datatypes is defined according to the [`ST_Intersects` PostGIS operation](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Intersects.html)

> If a geometry or geography shares any portion of space then they intersect. For geography -- tolerance is 0.00001 meters (so any points that are close are considered to intersect).<br>
> Overlaps, Touches, Within all imply spatial intersection. If any of the aforementioned returns true, then the geometries also spatially intersect. Disjoint implies false for spatial intersection.

### Municipality Boundary
Municipalities requiring MDS Provider API compliance should provide an unambiguous digital source for the municipality boundary. This boundary must be used when determining which data each `provider` API endpoint will include.

The boundary should be defined as a polygon or collection of polygons. The file defining the boundary should be provided in Shapefile or GeoJSON format and hosted online at a published address that all providers and `provider` API consumers can access and download.

### Timestamps

References to `timestamp` imply integer milliseconds since [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). You can find the implementation of unix timestamp in milliseconds for your programming language [here](https://currentmillis.com/).

## Trips

A trip represents a journey taken by a *mobility as a service* customer with a geo-tagged start and stop point.

The trips endpoint allows a user to query historical trip data.

Unless stated otherwise by the municipality, the trips endpoint must return all trips with a `route` which [intersects](#intersection-operation) with the [municipality boundary](#municipality-boundary).

Endpoint: `/trips`  
Method: `GET`  
Schema: [`trips` schema][trips-schema]  
`data` Payload: `{ "trips": [] }`, an array of objects with the following structure  


| Field | Type    | Required/Optional | Comments |
| ----- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| `provider_id` | UUID | Required | A UUID for the Provider, unique within MDS |
| `provider_name` | String | Required | The public-facing name of the Provider |
| `device_id` | UUID | Required | A unique device ID in UUID format |
| `vehicle_id` | String | Required | The Vehicle Identification Number visible on the vehicle itself |
| `vehicle_type` | Enum | Required | See [vehicle types](#vehicle-types) table |
| `propulsion_type` | Enum[] | Required | Array of [propulsion types](#propulsion-types); allows multiple values |
| `trip_id` | UUID | Required | A unique ID for each trip |
| `trip_duration` | Integer | Required | Time, in Seconds |
| `trip_distance` | Integer | Required | Trip Distance, in Meters |
| `route` | GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` | Required | See [Routes](#routes) detail below |
| `accuracy` | Integer | Required | The approximate level of accuracy, in meters, of `Points` within `route` |
| `start_time` | [timestamp][ts] | Required | |
| `end_time` | [timestamp][ts] | Required | |
| `publication_time` | [timestamp][ts] | Optional | Date/time that trip became available through the trips endpoint |
| `parking_verification_url` | String | Optional | A URL to a photo (or other evidence) of proper vehicle parking |
| `standard_cost` | Integer | Optional | The cost, in cents, that it would cost to perform that trip in the standard operation of the System |
| `actual_cost` | Integer | Optional | The actual cost, in cents, paid by the customer of the *mobility as a service* provider |

### Trips Query Parameters

The trips API should allow querying trips with a combination of query parameters.

* `device_id`
* `vehicle_id`
* `min_end_time`: filters for trips where `end_time` occurs at or after the given time
* `max_end_time`: filters for trips where `end_time` occurs before the given time

When multiple query parameters are specified, they should all apply to the returned trips. For example, a request with `?min_end_time=1549800000000&max_end_time=1549886400000` should only return trips whose end time falls in the range `[1549800000000, 1549886400000)`.

### Vehicle Types

| `vehicle_type` |
|--------------|
| bicycle      |
| scooter      |

### Propulsion Types

| `propulsion_type` | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| human           | Pedal or foot propulsion |
| electric_assist | Provides power only alongside human propulsion |
| electric        | Contains throttle mode with a battery-powered motor |
| combustion      | Contains throttle mode with a gas engine-powered motor |

A device may have one or more values from the `propulsion_type`, depending on the number of modes of operation. For example, a scooter that can be powered by foot or by electric motor would have the `propulsion_type` represented by the array `['human', 'electric']`. A bicycle with pedal-assist would have the `propulsion_type` represented by the array `['human', 'electric_assist']` if it can also be operated as a traditional bicycle.

### Routes

To represent a route, MDS `provider` APIs must create a GeoJSON [`FeatureCollection`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3), which includes every [observed point][geo] in the route, even those which occur outside the [municipality boundary](#municipality-boundary).

Routes must include at least 2 points: the start point and end point. Routes must include all possible GPS or GNSS samples collected by a Provider. Providers may round the latitude and longitude to the level of precision representing the maximum accuracy of the specific measurement. For example, [a-GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_GPS) is accurate to 5 decimal places, [differential GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_GPS) is generally accurate to 6 decimal places. Providers may round those readings to the appropriate number for their systems.

```js
"route": {
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [{
        "type": "Feature",
        "properties": {
            "timestamp": 1529968782421
        },
        "geometry": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [
                -118.46710503101347,
                33.9909333514159
            ]
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "Feature",
        "properties": {
            "timestamp": 1531007628377
        },
        "geometry": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [
                -118.464851975441,
                33.990366257735
            ]
        }
    }]
}
```

## Status Changes

The status of the inventory of vehicles available for customer use.

The status changes endpoint allows a user to query the historical availability for a system within a time range.

Unless stated otherwise by the municipality, this endpoint must return only those status changes with a `event_location` that [intersects](#intersection-operation) with the [municipality boundary](#municipality-boundary).

> Note: As a result of this definition, consumers should query the [trips endpoint](#trips) to infer when vehicles enter or leave the municipality boundary.

Endpoint: `/status_changes`  
Method: `GET`  
Schema: [`status_changes` schema][sc-schema]  
`data` Payload: `{ "status_changes": [] }`, an array of objects with the following structure

| Field | Type | Required/Optional | Comments |
| ----- | ---- | ----------------- | ----- |
| `provider_id` | UUID | Required | A UUID for the Provider, unique within MDS |
| `provider_name` | String | Required | The public-facing name of the Provider |
| `device_id` | UUID | Required | A unique device ID in UUID format |
| `vehicle_id` | String | Required | The Vehicle Identification Number visible on the vehicle itself |
| `vehicle_type` | Enum | Required | see [vehicle types](#vehicle-types) table |
| `propulsion_type` | Enum[] | Required | Array of [propulsion types](#propulsion-types); allows multiple values |
| `event_type` | Enum | Required | See [event types](#event-types) table |
| `event_type_reason` | Enum | Required | Reason for status change, allowable values determined by [`event type`](#event-types) |
| `event_time` | [timestamp][ts] | Required | Date/time that event occurred at. See [Event Times](#event-times) |
| `publication_time` | [timestamp][ts] | Optional | Date/time that event became available through the status changes endpoint |
| `event_location` | GeoJSON [Point Feature][geo] | Required | |
| `battery_pct` | Float | Required if Applicable | Percent battery charge of device, expressed between 0 and 1 |
| `associated_trip` | UUID | Required if Applicable | Trip UUID (foreign key to Trips API), required if `event_type_reason` is `user_pick_up` or `user_drop_off`, or for any other status change event that marks the end of a trip. |

### Event Times

Because of the unreliability of device clocks, the Provider is unlikely to know with total confidence what time an event occurred at. However, they are responsible for constructing as accurate a timeline as possible. Most importantly, the order of the timestamps for a particular device's events must reflect the Provider's best understanding of the order in which those events occurred.

### Status Changes Query Parameters

The status_changes API should allow querying status changes with a combination of query parameters.

* `start_time`: filters for status changes where `event_time` occurs at or after the given time
* `end_time`: filters for status changes where `event_time` occurs before the given time

When multiple query parameters are specified, they should all apply to the returned status changes. For example, a request with `?start_time=1549800000000&end_time=1549886400000` should only return status changes whose `event_time` falls in the range `[1549800000000, 1549886400000)`.

### Event Types

| `event_type` | Description | `event_type_reason` | Description |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| `available` | A device becomes available for customer use | `service_start` | Device introduced into service at the beginning of the day (if program does not operate 24/7) |
| | | `user_drop_off` | User ends reservation |
| | | `rebalance_drop_off` | Device moved for rebalancing |
| | | `maintenance_drop_off` | Device introduced into service after being removed for maintenance |
| | | `agency_drop_off` | The administrative agency (ie, DOT) drops a device into the PROW using an admin code or similar | 
| `reserved` | A customer reserves a device (even if trip has not started yet) | `user_pick_up` | Customer reserves device |
| `unavailable` | A device is on the street but becomes unavailable for customer use | `maintenance` | A device is no longer available due to equipment issues |
| | | `low_battery` | A device is no longer available due to insufficient battery |
| `removed` | A device is removed from the street and unavailable for customer use | `service_end` | Device removed from street because service has ended for the day (if program does not operate 24/7) |
| | | `rebalance_pick_up` | Device removed from street and will be placed at another location to rebalance service |
| | | `maintenance_pick_up` | Device removed from street so it can be worked on |
| | | `agency_pick_up` | The administrative agency (ie, DOT) removes a device using an admin code or similar |

## Realtime Data

All MDS compatible `provider` APIs must expose a public [GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs) feed as well. Given that GBFS hasn't fully [evolved to support dockless mobility](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/pull/92) yet, we follow the current guidelines in making bike information avaliable to the public. 

  - `gbfs.json` is always required and must contain a `feeds` property that lists all published feeds
  - `system_information.json` is always required
  - `free_bike_status.json` is required for MDS
  - `station_information.json` and `station_status.json` don't apply for MDS
