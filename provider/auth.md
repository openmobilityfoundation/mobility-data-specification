# Authorization

MDS `providers` **SHALL** provide authorization for API endpoints via a bearer token based auth system.

For example, the `Authorization` header sent as part of an HTTP request:

```
GET /trips HTTP/1.1
Host: api.provider.co
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## JSON Web Tokens

JSON Web Token ([JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/)) is **RECOMMENDED** as the token format.

JWTs provide a safe, secure way to verify the identity of an agency and provide access to MDS resources without providing access to other, potentially sensitive data.

> JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard ([RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

MDS `providers` **MAY** include any metadata in the JWT they wish that helps to route, log, permission, or debug agency requests, leaving their internal implementation flexible.

JWT provides a helpful [debugger](https://jwt.io/#debugger) for testing your token and verifying security.

## OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0's `client_credentials` grant type (outlined in [RFC6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4)) is **RECOMMENDED** as the authentication and authorization scheme.

OAuth 2.0 is an industry standard authorization framework with a variety of existing tooling. The `client_credentials` grant type facilitates generation of tokens that can be used for access by agencies and distributed to data partners.

If an MDS `provider` implements this auth scheme, it **MAY** choose to specify token scopes that define access parameters like allowable time ranges. These guidelines **SHOULD** be encoded into the returned token in a parseable way.

## Endpoint Authentication Requirements  

The `/trips` and `/status_changes` endpoints may or may not require authentication, it is up to the implementing provider to decide if they want historical information available with or without authentication. 

As of MDS 0.3.0, `gbfs.json` is required. The required GBFS endpoints should be made available publicly. See [#realtime-data](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/tree/master/provider#realtime-data) for more information about how to implement GBFS for dockless systems.
