# Mobility Data Specification: Policy

<a href="/policy/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/66QXveN.png" width="120" align="right" alt="MDS Policy Icon" border="0"></a>

The Policy API endpoints are intended to be implemented by regulatory agencies and consumed by mobility providers. Providers query the Policy API to get information about local rules that may affect the operation of their mobility service or which may be used to determine compliance.

This specification describes the digital relationship between _mobility as a service_ providers and the agencies that regulate them. The Policy API communicates municipal policies (such as as vehicle deployment caps and speed limits) in a clear, consistent manner.

## General information

The following information applies to all `policy` API endpoints.

[Top][toc]

### Update Frequency

The publishing agency should establish beforehand and communicate to providers how frequently the Policy endpoints are expected to change, how often they should be polled to get the latest information, and expectations around emergency updates.

[Top][toc]

### Versioning

`policy` APIs must handle requests for specific versions of the specification from clients.

Versioning must be implemented as specified in the [Versioning section][versioning].

[Top][toc]

## Background

The goal of the Policy API specification is to enable agencies to create, revise, and publish machine-readable policies, as sets of rules for individual and collective device behavior exhibited by both _mobility as a service_ providers and riders / users. [Examples](./examples/README.md) of policies include:

- City-wide and localized caps (e.g. "Minimum 500 and maximum 3000 scooters within city boundaries")
- Exclusion zones (e.g. "No scooters are permitted in this district on weekends")
- Cap allowances (e.g. "Up to 500 additional scooters are permitted near train stations")
- Speed-limit restrictions (e.g. "15 mph outside of downtown, 10 mph downtown")
- Idle-time and disabled-time limitations (e.g. "5 days idle while rentable, 12 hours idle while unrentable, per device")
- Trip fees and subsidies (e.g. "A 25 cent fee applied when a trip ends downtown")

The machine-readable format allows Providers to obtain policies and compute compliance where it can be determined entirely by data obtained internally, and know what data is required from them and provided to them.

**See the [Policy Examples](./examples/README.md) for ways these can be implemented.**

[Top][toc]

## Distribution

Policies shall be published by regulatory bodies or their authorized delegates as JSON objects. These JSON objects shall be served by either [flat files](#flat-files) or via [REST API endpoints](#rest-endpoints). In either case, policy data shall follow the [schema](#schema) outlined below.

Policies typically refer to one or more associated geographies. Geographic information is obtained from the MDS [Geography](/geography#general-information) API.  Each policy and geography shall have a unique ID (UUID).

Published policies, like geographies, should be treated as immutable data. Obsoleting or otherwise changing a policy is accomplished by publishing a new policy with a field named `prev_policies`, a list of UUID references to the policy or policies superseded by the new policy.

Geographical data shall be represented as GeoJSON `Feature` objects. No part of the geographical data should be outside the [municipality boundary][muni-boundary].

Policies should be re-fetched whenever:

1) a policy expires (via its `end_date`), or
2) at an interval specified by the regulatory body, e.g. "daily at midnight".

Flat files have an optional `end_date` field that will apply to the file as a whole.

[Top][toc]

## REST Endpoints

Among other use-cases, configuring a REST API allows an Agency to:

1) Dynamically adjust caps
2) Set Provider specific policies
3) Adjust other attributes in closer to real time
4) Enumerate when policies are set to change

Responses must set the `Content-Type` header, as specified in the [versioning][versioning] section.

### Responses and Error Messages

The response to a client request must include a valid HTTP status code defined in the [IANA HTTP Status Code Registry][iana].

See the [Responses section][responses] for information on valid MDS response codes and the [Error Messages section][error-messages] for information on formatting error messages.

### Authorization

Authorization is not required and agencies are encouraged to make these endpoints unauthenticated and public. See [Optional Authentication](/general-information.md#optional-authentication) for details.

### Policies

**Endpoint**: `/policies/{id}`  
**Method**: `GET`  
**Schema:** [`policy` schema][json-schema]  
**`data` Payload**: `{ "policies": [] }`, an array of objects with the structure [outlined below](#policy).

#### Query Parameters

| Name         | Type      | Required / Optional | Description                                    |
| ------------ | --------- | --- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | UUID      | Optional    | If provided, returns one policy object with the matching UUID; default is to return all policy objects.                       |
| `start_date` | [timestamp][ts] | Optional    | Earliest effective date; default is policies effective as of the request time |
| `end_date`   | [timestamp][ts] | Optional    | Latest effective date; default is all policies effective in the future    |

`start_date` and `end_date` are only considered when no `id` parameter is provided.

Policies will be returned in order of effective date (see schema below), with pagination as in the `agency` and `provider` specs.

`provider_id` is an implicit parameter and will be encoded in the authentication mechanism, or a complete list of policies should be produced. If the Agency decides that Provider-specific policy documents should not be shared with other Providers (e.g. punitive policy in response to violations), an Agency should filter policy objects before serving them via this endpoint.

### Geographies

**Deprecated:** see the new [Geography API](/geography#transition-from-policy) to understand the transistion away from this endpoint, and how to support both in MDS 1.x.0 releases.

**Endpoint**: `/geographies/{id}`  
**Method**: `GET`  
**Schema:** [`policy` schema][json-schema]  
**`data` Payload**: `{ geographies: [] }`, an array of GeoJSON `Feature` objects that follow the schema [outlined here](#geography) or in [Geography](/geography#general-information).

#### Query Parameters

| Name         | Type      | Required / Optional | Description                                    |
| ------------ | --------- | --- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | UUID      | Optional    | If provided, returns one [Geography](/geography#general-information) object with the matching UUID; default is to return all geography objects.               |

[Top][toc]

### Requirements

**Endpoint**: `/requirements/`  
**Method**: `GET`  
**[Beta feature](/general-information.md#beta-features)**: *Yes (as of 1.2.0)*. [Leave feedback](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/682)  
**Schema:** TBD when out of beta
**`data` Payload**: `{ requirements: [] }`, JSON objects that follow the schema [outlined here](#requirement).  

See [Policy Requirements Examples](/policy/examples/requirements.md) for how this can be implemented.

[Top][toc]

## Flat Files

To use flat files, policies shall be represented in two (2) files:

- `policies.json`
- `geographies.json`

The files shall be structured like the output of the [REST endpoints](#rest-endpoints) above.

The publishing Agency should establish and communicate to providers how frequently these files should be polled.

The `updated` field in the payload wrapper should be set to the time of publishing a revision, so that it is simple to identify a changed file.

### Example `policies.json`

```jsonc
{
    "version": "0.4.0",
    "updated": 1570035222868,
    "end_date": 1570035222868,
    "data": {
        "policies": [
            {
                // policy JSON 1
            },
            {
                // policy JSON 2
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The optional `end_date` field applies to all policies represented in the file.

### Example `geographies.json`

```jsonc
{
    "version": "0.4.0",
    "updated": 1570035222868,
    "data": {
        "geographies": [
            {
                // GeoJSON Feature 1
            },
            {
                // GeoJSON Feature 2
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

[Top][toc]

## Schema

All response fields must use `lower_case_with_underscores`.

Response bodies must be a `UTF-8` encoded JSON object and must minimally include the MDS `version`, a timestamp indicating the last time the data was `updated`, and a `data` payload:

```jsonc
{
    "version": "x.y.z",
    "updated": 1570035222868,
    "data": {
        // endpoint/file specific payload
    }
}
```

### JSON Schema

The JSON Schema file is available in this repository: [`policy.json`](./policy.json).

Before publishing a new Policy document, the document should be validated against the schema to ensure it has the correct format and fields.

### Rule Types

| Name    | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `count` | Fleet counts based on regions. Rule `minimum`/`maximum` refers to number of devices in [Rule Units](#rule-units).                                  |
| `time`  | Individual limitations or fees based upon time spent in one or more vehicle states. Rule `minimum`/`maximum` refers to increments of time in [Rule Units](#rule-units). |
| `speed` | Global or local speed limits. Rule `minimum`/`maximum` refers to speed in [Rule Units](#rule-units).                  |
| `rate`  | **[Beta feature](/general-information.md#beta-features):** *Yes (as of 1.0.0)*. Fees or subsidies based on regions and time spent in one or more vehicle states. Rule `rate_amount` refers to the rate charged according to the [Rate Recurrences](#rate_recurrences) and the [currency requirements](/general-information.md#costs-and-currencies) in [Rule Units](#rule-units). *Prior to implementation agencies should consult with providers to discuss how the `rate` rule will be used. Most agencies do this as a matter of course, but it is particularly important to communicate in advance how frequently and in what ways rates might change over time.*    |
| `user`  | Information for users, e.g. about helmet laws. Generally can't be enforced via events and telemetry.          |

### Geography

**Deprecated:** see the new [Geography API](/geography#transition-from-policy) to understand the transistion away from this endpoint, and how to support both in a MDS 1.x.0 release.

| Name             | Type      | Required / Optional | Description                                                                         |

| `geography_json`   | JSON      | Required   | The GeoJSON that defines the geographical coordinates.
| `effective_date`   | [timestamp][ts] | Optional   | `start_date` for first published policy that uses this geo.  Server should set this when policies are published.  This may be used on the client to distinguish between “logical” geographies that have the same name. E.g. if a policy publishes a geography on 5/1/2020, and then another policy is published which references that same geography is published on 4/1/2020, the effective_date will be set to 4/1/2020.
| `publish_date`   | [timestamp][ts] | Required   | Timestamp that the policy was published, i.e. made immutable                                             |

### Rates
Rate-related properties can currently be specified on `rate` and `time` Rules. Note: A future MDS version will likely support rates for `count` and `speed` rules, but their behavior is currently undefined.

**[Beta feature](/general-information.md#beta-features)**: *Yes (as of 1.0.0)*. [Leave feedback](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/674)  

#### Rate Amounts
The amount of a rate applied when this rule applies, if applicable (default zero). A positive integer rate amount represents a fee, while a negative integer represents a subsidy. Rate amounts are given in the `currency` defined in the [Policy](#policy).

#### Rate Recurrences

Rate recurrences specify how a rate is applied – either once, or periodically according to a `time_unit` specified using [Rule Units](#rule-units). A `time_unit` refers to a unit of time as measured in local time for the jurisdiction – a day begins at midnight local time, an hour begins at the top of the hour, etc.

| Name                        | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `once_on_match`             | Rate is applied once when a vehicle transitions **into** a matching status from a non-matching status.                                                            |
| `once_on_unmatch`           | Rate is applied once a vehicle transitions **out of** a matching status to a non-matching status.                                                                 |
| `each_time_unit`            | During each `time_unit`, rate is applied once to vehicles entering or remaining in a matching status. Requires a `time_unit` to be specified using `rule_units`.  |
| `per_complete_time_unit`    | Rate is applied once per complete `time_unit` that vehicles remain in a matching status. Requires a `time_unit` to be specified using `rule_units`.               |

[Top][toc]

#### Rate Applies When

The `rate_applies_when` field specifies when a rate should be applied to an event or count,
e.g. is it when the event is within the Rule bounds or when it is outside?
It defaults to `out_of_bounds`.

The `rate_applies_when` field may take the following values:

| Name            | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `in_bounds`     | Rate applies when an event or count is within the rule `minimum` and `maximum` |
| `out_of_bounds` | Rate applies when an event or count is outside of the rule `minimum` and `maximum` |

### Messages

Some Policies as established by the Agency may benefit from rider communication. This optional field contains a map of languages to messages, to be shown to the user.

Language identifier values will be per [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt).

Example for a decreased speed-limit rule for Venice Beach on weekends:

```json
"messages": {
    "en-US": "Remember to stay under 10 MPH on Venice Beach on weekends!",
    "es-US": "¡Recuerda mantener por debajo 10 millas por hora en Venice Beach los fines de semana!"
},
```

### Value URL

An Agency may wish to provide dynamic or global rules, e.g.

> "Within 300 yards of the stadium, 1000 total extra scooters may be deployed, across all Provider(s)."

In this case, compliance is not computable from the information available to a single Provider. The Agency may provide an endpoint to get the current count of vehicles in the service-area, so that individual Providers could decide whether adding some number to those present is allowed.

The payload returned from a `GET` request to the `value_url` will have the following immutable fields:

| Name        | Type      | Required / Optional | Description                         |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `value`     | integer   | Required         | Value of whatever the rule measures |
| `timestamp` | [timestamp][ts] | Required   | Timestamp the value was recorded    |
| `policy_id` | UUID      | Required         | Relevant `policy_id` for reference  |

[Top][toc]

### Order of Operations

Rules, being in a list, are ordered **most specific** to **most general**. E.g. an "earlier" rule (lower list index) would take precedence over a "later" rule (higher list index).

Rules are a form of pattern matching; conditions under which a given rule is "met" are specified, and a vehicle (or series of vehicles) may match with that rule or set of rules.

If a vehicle is matched with a rule, then it _will not_ be considered in the subsequent evaluation of rules within a given policy. This allows for expressing complex policies, such as a layer of "valid" geographies in an earlier rule, with overarching "invalid" geographies in later rules.

The internal mechanics of ordering are up to the Policy editing and hosting software.

### Requirement

A public agency's Policy program Requirements endpoint enumerates all of the parts of MDS, GBFS, and other specifications that an agency requires from providers for certain programs, including APIs, endpoints, and optional fields, as well as information for providers about the APIs the agency is hosting. The program requirements are specific to the needs and use cases of each agency, and ensure there is clarity on what data is being asked for in operating policy documents from providers, reducing the burden on both. This also allows additional public transparency and accountability around data requirements from agencies, and encourages privacy by allowing agencies to ask for only the data they need.

Requirements can also be used to define a scaled-down MDS implementation in situations where an agency has more limited regulatory goals, has legal limitations on the types of data they can collect, or wants to use a lightweight version of MDS for a pilot project or other experiment where aspects of a full MDS implementation would be irrelevant or unnecessary.

See [Policy Requirements Examples](/policy/examples/requirements.md) for ideas on how this can be implemented.

#### Public Hosting

This endpoint is not authenticated (ie. public), and allows the discovery of other public endpoints within Geography, Policy, and Jurisdiction. The agency can host this as a file or dynamic endpoint on their servers, on a third party server, or the OMF can host on behalf of an agency in the [agency program requirements repo](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/agency-program-requirements). See this [hosting guidance document](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/wiki/Policy-Requirements-OMF-Hosting-Guidance) for more information.  This requirements file can be [referenced directly](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/blob/main/technical/OMF-MDS-Policy-Language-Guidance.md) in an agency's operating permit/policy document when discussing program data requirements, and [updated digitally as needed](#requirement-update-frequency). To be compliant with MDS you must obtain an `agency_id` and list your public URL in [agencies.csv](/agencies.csv), per our [guidance document](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/wiki/Adding-an-MDS-Agency-ID).

#### Requirement Update Frequency

The OMF recommends updating the Requirements feed no more than monthly, and you may specify your expected timeframe with the `max_update_interval` in the [metadata](#requirement-metadata) section so providers have some idea of how often to check the feed. More specifically the OMF recommends giving the following notice to providers: 1 month for optional field additions, 3 months for endpoint/API changes/additions, 3 months for new minor releases, and 4 months for major releases. You should also communicate these future changes ahead of time with the `start_date` field. Finally, the OMF recommends any changes need to be part of a discussion between agencies and affected providers.

#### Version Tracking

If you are upgrading to a new MDS version, it is recommended to create a new requirements file at a new URL, since field names and available options may have changed. To make this more obvious, the MDS version number could be part of your URL, e.g. "https://mds.cityname.gov/requirements/1.2.0". 

When requirements are updated within the same MDS version, in the [metadata](#requirement-metadata) section, increment the `file_version` value by one and update the `last_updated` timestamp. Though not required, you may choose to use the  `start_date` and `end_date` fields in the [programs](#requirement-programs) section to keep retired requirements accessible. We also recommend hosting your requirements file in a location that has a publicly-accessible version history, like GitHub or Bitbucket, or keeping previous versions accessible with a versioned URL, e.g. "https://mds.cityname.gov/requirements/1.2.0/v3". 

#### Beta Limitations

Note that while Requirements is in [beta](#Requirements) in this **minor**, non-breaking MDS 1.2.0 release, items listed as "required" or "disallowed" will be treated as a _request_ only by default (precluding intentional formal agency communications with providers) to prevent an _unintentional_ burden on providers. For the next **major**, breaking MDS 2.0.0 release, these items will be required or disallowed as documented.

#### Requirement Format

An agency's program [Requirements](#requirements) endpoint contains a number of distinct parts, namely [metadata](#requirement-metadata), [program definitions](#requirement-programs), and [data specs](#requirement-data-specs) (with sub sections on relevant [required APIs](#requirement-apis)).

```jsonc

              }
            ]
          }
        },
        // other data specs per the "Requirement Data Specs" section
      ]
    },
    // other MDS versions per the "Requriement MDS Version" section
  }
}
```

#### Requirement Data Specs

For each combination of items in a program, you can specify the data specs, APIs, endpoints, and optional fields that are required per your agency's program policies. This is an array within the [Requirement MDS Versions](#requirement-mds-versions) `mds_apis` section in the [Requirement](#requirement) data feed.

```jsonc
// ...
      "required_data_specs": [
        {
          "data_spec_name": "[DATA SPEC NAME]",
          "version": "[VERSION NUMBER]",
          "required_apis": [
            {
              // Required APIs array
            }
          ],
          "available_apis": [
            {
              // Available APIs array
            }
          ]
        },
        // other data specs
      ]
// ...
```

[Top][toc]

#### Requirement APIs

For each data specification, you can specify which APIs, endpoints, and fields are required from providers, and which are available from your agency.

An agency may require providers to serve optional APIs, endpoints, and fields that are needed for your agency's program. This is a `required_apis` array within the [Requirement Data Specs](#requirement-data-specs) section in the [Requirement](#requirement) data feed.

**Note: any APIs, endpoints, or fields that are _required_ by a data specification are not to be listed, and are still required. Only optional items are enumerated here. You may however list `disallowed_fields` to exclude required fields. Optional APIs or endpoints should _NOT_ be returned unless specified.**

You may also show which APIs, endpoints, and fields your agency is serving to providers and the public. This is an `available_apis` array within the [Requirement Data Specs](#requirement-data-specs) section in the [Requirement](#requirement) data feed.

```jsonc
// ...
          "required_apis": [
            {
              "api_name" : "[API NAME]",
              "required_endpoints": [
                {
                  "endpoint_name" : "[ENDPOINT NAME]",
                  "required_fields": [
                    "[FIELD NAME]",
                    // other field names
                  ],
                  "disallowed_fields": [
                    "[FIELD NAME]",
                    // other field names
                  ]
                },
                // other endpoints
              ]
            },
            // other APIs in same data spec
          ],
          "available_apis": [
            {
              "api_name" : "[API NAME]",
              "available_endpoints": [
                {
                  "endpoint_name" : "[ENDPOINT NAME]",
                  "url": "[ENDPOINT URL]",
                  "available_fields": [
                    "[FIELD NAME]",
                    // other field names
                  ]
                },
                // other endpoints
              ]
            }
          ]
// ...
```

| Name                 | Type  | Required/Optional | Description                |
| -------------------- | ----- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `api_name`           | Text  | Required | Name of the applicable API required. At least one API is required. APIs not listed will not be available to the agency. E.g. for MDS: 'provider', or 'agency'. For GBFS, this field is omitted since GBFS starts at the `endpoint` level. |
| `endpoint_name`      | Text  | Required | Name of the required endpoint under the API. At least one endpoint is required. E.g. for MDS 'provider': 'trips' |

**Provider Endpoints** - Specific to the `required_apis` array

| Name                 | Type  | Required/Optional | Description                |
| -------------------- | ----- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `required_endpoints` | Array | Required | Array of optional endpoints required by the agency. At least one is required. Endpoints not listed will not be available to the agency. |
| `required_fields`    | Array | Optional | Array of optional field names required by the agency. Can be omitted if no optional fields are required. Use dot notation for nested fields. See **special notes** below. |
| `disallowed_fields`  | Array | Optional | Array of optional field names which must not be returned by in the endpoint, even if required in MDS. Use dot notation for nested fields. See **special notes** below. |

**Agency Endpoints** - Specific to the `available_apis` array

| Name                 | Type  | Required/Optional | Description                |
| -------------------- | ----- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `available_endpoints`| Array | Required | Array of endpoints provided by the agency. At least one is required. Endpoints not listed will not be available to the provider. |
| `url`                | URL   | Optional | Location of API endpoint url. Required if the API is unauthenticated and public, optional if endpoint is authenticated and private. E.g. "https://mds.cityname.gov/geographies/geography/1.1.0"  |
| `available_fields`   | Array | Optional | Array of optional field names provided by the agency. Can be omitted if none are required. Use dot notation for nested fields. See **special notes** below. |

**Special notes about `required_fields` and `disallowed_fields`.**

- All fields marked 'Required' in MDS are still included by default and should not be enumerated in `required_fields`. They are not affected by the Requirements endpoint, unless explicitly listed in `disallowed_fields`.
- Fields in MDS marked 'Required if available' are still returned if available, and are not affected by the Requirements endpoint, unless explicitly listed in `disallowed_fields`.
- If a 'Required' or 'Required if available' or 'Optional' field in MDS is listed in `disallowed_fields`, those fields should not be returned by the provider in the endpoint. The field (and therefore its value) must be completely removed from the response. If used, [schema](/schema) validation may fail on missing required fields.
- To reference fields that are lower in a heirarchy, use [dot separated notation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/adjsn/simple-dot-notation-access-to-json-data.html#GUID-7249417B-A337-4854-8040-192D5CEFD576), where a dot between field names represents one nested level deeper into the data structure. E.g. 'gps.heading' or 'features.properties.rules.vehicle_type_id'.
- To require [Greography Driven Events](/general-information.md#geography-driven-events), simply include the `event_geographies` field for either the Agency or Provider API `api_name`. Per how GDEs work, `event_location` will then not be returned, and the `changed_geographies` vehicle state `event_type` will be used.
- [While in beta](#beta-limitations), items marked as required or disallowed will only be considered a 'request' by providers, unless agencies have communicated with providers outside of MDS.
