# Mobility Data Specification: Jurisdiction

<a href="/jurisdiction/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tCRCfxT.png" width="120" align="right" alt="MDS Jurisdiction Icon" border="0"></a>

This specification details the purpose, use cases, and schema for Jurisdictions. Jurisdictions are an optional service that are served by a coordinated group of agencies. Jurisdictions can be '[optionally authenticated](/general-information.md#optional-authentication)', making the endpoints unauthenticated and public. In the future this will shift to 'optionally private', where Jursidictions will be public by default. Note that it serves a different purpose from the [Geography](/geography) API, though it does reference areas within Geography by ID.

## Background

City and transportation agencies need to regulate mobility within their own jurisdictions. Within a collection of agencies under a single MDS software deployment, those agencies need to coordinate and share relevant data between one another when their jurisdictions overlap.

The jurisdictions API helps to solve the following problems when implementing MDS in a multi-jurisdictional environment:

- Giving agencies a mechanism to communicate boundaries between one another and to mobility providers.
- Some agencies manage multiple overlapping jurisdictions and need a mechanism to administer scope and permissions to data.

A jurisdiction is:

- A representation of an agencyâ€™s authority to the outside world
- Human-readable name
- Uniquely identified
- Purview to make rules over physical boundaries and modal boundaries (e.g. a jurisdiction could be for taxis only)
- A way of tracking revisions in an agency's authority

## Beta Feature

The Jurisdictions API and all of its endpoints are marked as a [beta feature](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/blob/feature-metrics/general-information.md#beta-features) starting in the 1.1.0 release. It has not been tested in real world scenarios, and may be adjusted in future releases.

**[Beta feature](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/blob/feature-metrics/general-information.md#beta-features)**: _Yes (as of 1.1.0)_. [Leave feedback](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/issues/673) 

## Use Cases

### 1. Defining boundaries and what the vehicle state `elsewhere` means

For a single jurisdiction MDS deployment, a city designates a jurisdiction that providers can reference and know in what area to send events. When a trip leaves the LADOT jurisdiction, providers need to send an event with the vehicle state set to `elsewhere`.

Cities and agencies contained within the MPO would internally be able filter for their own jurisdictional data. This would allow mobility providers to not need to send MDS data to multiple MDS instances.

In addition, Agency authority have an explicit revision mechanism through a canonical API.

### 2. Clarifying overlapping authority

Agencies and mobility providers would be able to understand agency authority in a geographical area and in what mobility mode through a list of jurisdictions..

Example: LADOT has jurisdictional authority over the city of Los Angeles for micromobility permitting, and jurisdictional authority over the county of Los Angeles for taxi permitting.

### 3. Access scoping

Example: A SaaS company contracts with Miami-Dade County to provide MDS. There are 34 cities within the county. Miami-Dade County needs to assign permissions to each city to control who writes policy, based on jurisdictions. A Jurisdictions object with a stable identifier can be used for access control.

### 4. Agencies need to grant application access

Example: The City of Miami has different data visualization tools from the city of Coral Gables
Those tools can be granted data access from the SaaS tool based on the jurisdiction's stable identifier.

## Distribution

Jurisdictions can be served by agencies through the following REST API, or via [flat-files](#flat-files). Agencies may choose to make the endpoints public and non-authenticated.

### REST

All response fields must use `lower_case_with_underscores`.

Responses must set the `Content-Type` header, as specified in the [Provider versioning](../provider/README.md#versioning) section. They must also specify the current API version being served in the JSON-formatted response body, under the `version` key.

Response bodies must be a `UTF-8` encoded JSON object.

#### HTTP Response Codes

The response to a client request must include a valid HTTP status code defined in the [IANA HTTP Status Code Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml)

## Schema

A Jurisdiction optionally contains a reference to a Geography object. This reference may change over time, e.g. if two

When a Jurisdiction is updated, the old version should remain in the back-end for archival purposes.

An individual `Jurisdiction` object is defined by the following fields:

| Name              | Type      | Required / Optional | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Formatted in JSON, a Jurisdiction object should look like this:

```
{
	"jurisdiction_id": UUID,
	"agency_key": string,
	"agency_name": string,
	"geography_id": UUID,
	"mobility_modes": [
		string
	],
	"timestamp": Timestamp
}
```

## Flat Files

To use flat files, Jurisdictions shall be represented in the following files:

- `jurisdictions.json`
- `geographies.json`

The format and content of `jurisdictions.json` should resemble the responses from `GET /jurisdictions`.

The publishing Agency should establish and communicate to interested parties how frequently these files should be polled.

The `updated` field in the payload wrapper should be set to the time of publishing a revision, so that it is simple to identify a changed file.

## Examples

See the [Jurisdiction Examples](examples/README.md) for a sample `jurisdictions.json` file. 

See the [Geography Examples](/geography/examples/README.md) for an example `geographies.json`.
