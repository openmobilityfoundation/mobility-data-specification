# Mobility Data Specification: **Agency**

<a href="/agency/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HzMWtaI.png" width="120" align="right" alt="MDS Agency Icon" border="0"></a>

The Agency API endpoints are intended to be implemented by regulatory agencies and consumed by mobility providers. Providers query the Agency API when events (such as a trip start or vehicle status change) occur in their systems.

This specification contains a collection of RESTful APIs used to specify the digital relationship between *mobility as a service* providers and the agencies that regulate them.

## General information

This specification uses data types including timestamps, UUIDs, and vehicle state definitions as described in the MDS [General Information][general] document.

[Top][toc]

### Versioning

`agency` APIs must handle requests for specific versions of the specification from clients.

Versioning must be implemented as specified in the [Versioning section][versioning].

[Top][toc]

### Responses and Error Messages

See the [Responses][responses] and [Error Messages][error-messages] sections.

[Top][toc]

### Authorization

When making requests, the Agency API expects `provider_id` to be part of the claims in a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) `access_token` in the `Authorization` header, in the form `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. The token issuance, expiration and revocation policies are at the discretion of the Agency.

## Vehicles

The `/vehicles` endpoint returns the specified vehicle (if a device_id is provided) or a list of known vehicles. Providers can only retrieve data for vehicles in their registered fleet.

Endpoint: `/vehicles/{device_id}`
Method: `GET`

Path Params:

| Param        | Type | Required/Optional | Description                                 |
| ------------ | ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `device_id`  | UUID | Optional          | If provided, retrieve the specified vehicle |

200 Success Response:

If `device_id` is specified, `GET` will return an array with a single vehicle record, otherwise it will be a list of vehicle records with pagination details per the [JSON API](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination) spec:

```json
{
    "vehicles": [ ... ]
    "links": {
        "first": "https://...",
        "last": "https://...",
        "prev": "https://...",
        "next": "https://..."
    }
}
```

A vehicle record is as follows:

| Field         | Type      | Field Description                       |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `vehicle_type`        | Enum      | [Vehicle Type][vehicle-types]           |
| `propulsion_types`  | Enum[]    | Array of [Propulsion Type][propulsion-types]; allows multiple values          |
| `vehicle_attributes`        | Array of [vehicle attributes](/modes/#vehicle-attributes)   | Vehicle attributes appropriate for the current [mode][modes] |
| `state`       | Enum      | Current vehicle state. See [Vehicle State][vehicle-states]                    |
| `prev_events`  | Enum[]      | Last [Vehicle Event][vehicle-events]                                           |

## Reservation Type

The reservation type enum expresses the urgency of a given reservation. This can be useful when attempting to quantify metrics around trips: for example, computing passenger wait-time. In the `on_demand` case, passenger wait-time may be quantified by the delta between the `reservation_time`, and the pick-up time; however, in the `scheduled` case, the wait time may be quantified based on the delta between the `scheduled_trip_start_time` found in the Trips payload, and the actual `trip_start_time`. 

| `reservation_type` | Description                                                            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `on_demand`        | The passenger requested the vehicle as soon as possible                |
| `scheduled`        | The passenger requested the vehicle for a scheduled time in the future |

[Top][toc]

## Reservation Method

The reservation method enum describes the different ways in which a passenger can create their reservation.

| `reservation_method` | Description                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `app`                | Reservation was made through an application (mobile/web)  |
| `street_hail`        | Reservation was made by the passenger hailing the vehicle |
| `phone_dispatch`     | Reservation was made by calling the dispatch operator     |

## Trip Metadata

The Trips endpoint serves two purposes: 

* Definitively indicating that a Trip (a sequence of events linked by a trip_id) has been completed. For example, from analyzing only the raw Vehicle Events feed, if a trip crosses an Agency's jurisdictional boundaries but does not end within the jurisdiction (last event_type seen is a `leave_jurisdiction`), this can result in a 'dangling trip'. The Trips endpoint satisfies this concern, by acting as a final indication that a trip has been finished, even if it ends outside of jurisdictional boundaries; if a trip has intersected an Agency's jurisdictional boundaries at all during a trip, it is expected that a Provider will send a Trip payload to the Agency following the trip's completion.
* Providing information to an Agency regarding an entire trip, without extending any of the Vehicle Event payloads, or changing any requirements on when Vehicle Events should be sent.
